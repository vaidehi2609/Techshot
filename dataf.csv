","For business owners, phone calls can be an enormous time waster. Take the restaurant industry, for example. Calls can lead to more important tasks being overlooked, like doing inventory, balancing staff schedules, running payroll and fixing equipment issues. The issue, exacerbated by the pandemic, is so severe that restaurants are increasingly abandoning their phone lines.
Alex Sambvani and Gabriel Duncan, who met while working at Spotify, set out to solve the problem of overwhelming incoming calls using AI, drawing on their backgrounds as data scientists. What emerged from their joint work is Slang.ai, a platform that automatically answers the phone for restaurants, retailers and other types of brick-and-mortar businesses.
“Slang acts like a reliable team member that gives accurate responses and helps drive more revenue, giving businesses AI superpowers and empowering them to provide exceptional service to callers and streamline operations in a personalized manner,” Sambvani told TechCrunch via email.
In plainer, less jargony and fluffy English, Slang acts as a sort of digital phone concierge that answers questions and takes — or modifies — reservations, including OpenTable and Resy reservations via integrations. Using Slang, callers can book or modify reservations or even simply let a business know that they're running late.

Businesses can decide which calls Slang handles automatically versus hands off to staff. Sambvani claims that Slang's automatic speech recognition works for callers of all ages and understands different accents — an impressive feat if true, given automatic speech recognition tech's historically poor handling of diverse dialects.
“Many brick-and-mortar businesses are understaffed, causing them to miss calls and send potential customers to voicemail where they lose out on potential revenue,” he continued. “Slang provides its clients access to previously unknown data about why customers are calling … [And it] can surface trending reasons why customers are calling and can help operators proactively identify opportunities or issues, such as a location getting an abnormal amount of complaints relative to other locations.”
Slang isn't the only startup selling a vision of tech to cut down on unnecessary phone interactions. There's Goodcall, which offers a free cloud-based, AI-powered conversational platform to manage incoming phone calls. Kea is building phone-answering AI specifically for restaurants. So is ConverseNow, whose AI voice assistants take orders in quick service restaurants via the phone, chat, drive-thru and self-service kiosks.
So what does Slang bring to the table that sets it apart? A large customer base, mainly, According to Sambvani, Slang has over 200 clients today, including Slutty Vegan, Palm House Hospitality Group, Studs, Planta, Hammitt and Nikki Beach Miami. Revenue grew 6x in 2022.

That success led investors to pour $20 million into Slang — $8 million as a part of a seed round and $12 million in a Series A. Homebrew led the latter with participation from Stage 2 Capital, Wing VC, Underscore VC, Active Capital and Collide Capital.
Sambvani says that the proceeds will be used to establish new partnerships and integrations in the restaurant, hospitality, retail and ecommerce industries, grow Slang's go-to-market team and expand headcount from 18 employees to 40 by the end of the year.

","Smartphone sales are in decline as handset makers grapple with saturated markets and a tough consumer economic climate. But some are betting on a future where new approaches in design and tech will still find resonance with users. Nothing, the London startup behind the “Phone” smartphone, has closed an investment of $96 million — funding that it will be using to continue scaling its business and lineup of devices, starting with its next smartphone. The Phone (2) — in keeping with its naming scheme — is due to launch in the coming weeks.
Highland Europe is leading the round, with previous backers GV (Google Ventures), EQT Ventures and C Capital also participating. Swedish House Mafia is also getting a strategic stake, one that's already being put to work. Nothing is teasing features for the new Phone (2) and yesterday it announced that it will have customizable “visual” ringtones, with one of the sound packs for the feature composed by the electronic/house music supergroup.
This investment brings the total raised by the company to $250 million — including two rounds of crowdfunding totaling some $11.5 million. Nothing is not disclosing its valuation. (We're trying to find out and will update as we learn more.)
The round, critically, is the biggest raised to date by the company — which closed a $70 million Series B in March of last year. From what we understand it had no shortage of inbound interest, despite the double pressures of crunch time in the smartphone market and the ongoing startup investment drought.
Part of the reason for that has been its metrics: sources close to the company confirm to us that it made $200 million in revenues in 2022 and is already on track to exceed that this year. It's also now sold 1.5 million devices over has launched one handset and two editions of its ear buds and it's sold 1.5 million devices overall, including 800,000 handsets, from what I understand. (For comparison, in February, CEO and co-founder Carl Pei told us that the company had shifted 1 million devices.)
“Over the last two years, to be able to do all of that in this market, it's a testament to what this team can achieve,” Tom Hulme of Google Ventures said in an interview. (Hulme also sits on the board of the startup.)
The new Phone device, which is lined for a July 11 launch, will be a key part of Nothing's strategy to grow. The Phone (1) had a limited release — namely, it did not launch in the U.S. — because of band support. The Phone (2) fixes that and will be offered in the U.S. market. Initially at least, that launch will not be in partnership with any handset makers, we understand.
In terms of Nothing's future product roadmap, Pei has told us in the past that there will definitely be more hardware form factors to come, without detailing what those might be. The company has a very active community of nearly 46,000 people on Discord who not only chatter about current products but also suggest concepts for what Nothing might build in the future. At least one of these — a smartwatch — was recently shared by Nothing with a hint to “watch this space.”
Another area that Pei recently has been waxing lyrical about is the future of software, so that is another area — services and apps — where Nothing might be looking to do a little something.
Armed with the new funding, it will likely be ramping up its talent base in aid of that. The company currently has 450 employees and only recently started to bring on software engineers alongside its team of hardware specialists.
“In just over two years, we’ve assembled one of the strongest teams in the industry and sold over 1.5 million devices worldwide,” said Pei in a statement. “It’s clear that there’s real demand for an innovative challenger in the consumer tech industry, and with this new round of financing, we’ve never been better positioned to realize our vision to make tech fun again.”
The company's focus and execution will be key for the next stage.
Highland partner Tony Zappalà, who is leading the round for his firm, said in an interview that he'd been introduced to the team a couple of years ago, but he declined to invest initially.
It was before the launch of its first phone, he recalled, and “When I first met the team I thought it was completely crazy to launch a new phone, and I was negatively predisposed,” he said. “But they managed to launch and make a success of it, selling hundreds of thousands of units, and great reviews.”
Investors believe that there is an opportunity for a viable new player alongside Apple and Samsung, the two that dominate smartphones, followed by a very long tail of smaller producers.
“But not everyone wants an iPhone or a Samsung device,” Zappalà said. “Carl’s thesis is that the smartphone market is huge market, and if you can make a cool product you can still do something really good. This team is doing that that based on an interesting connection between design, usability and relationships with users.” He also pointed out that Pei's background, previously with OnePlue, gives the company a huge advantage in building and manufacturing hardware.

","The commercial space industry is populated with new services and applications that would’ve been unimaginable even twenty years ago. None of this new activity would be possible without a robust computing infrastructure – including processors and storage systems – that ensure that satellites can communicate with Earth, and to each other.
But there are limitations to in-space computational capabilities, mainly due to the power requirements of data processing – at least, that’s according to Ramon.Space, a company that wants to level up compute with a suite of radiation-hardened products with low power requirements, but no subsequent sacrifice in computation levels.
To scale its advanced computing products, the company announced today that it has raised $26 million from Ingrasys, a Foxconn Technology Group subsidiary, and the United Arab Emirates’ Strategic Development Fund. Existing investors Grove Ventures, Deep Insight and UMC Capital also participated.
Ramon.Space, which has offices in California and Israel, develops software-based computing systems for space that allow data to be processed, stored, or moved to Earth or another spacecraft. Its technology has been used in 50 space missions, including missions with NASA and the European Space Agency, and “a few hundred” satellites, a Ramon.Space spokesperson told TechCrunch.
The nine-year-old company’s products including systems for processing, storage and communication. Earlier this month, Ramon.Space announced a manufacturing agreement with Ingrasys, to establish what the two companies say will be “the industry’s first high-volume space computing products” production line.
“Space-grade computing solutions have become an essential foundation for the evolution of the space economy,” Avi Shabtai, CEO of Ramon.Space, said in a statement. “The demand from satellite manufacturers, operators and service providers for such solutions is growing, driven by new business models and a goal to maintain agility of services in orbit. This new investment will allow Ramon.Space to scale its organization to meet market needs.”

","Joby Aviation has reached a series of milestones that put it on track to deliver its first electric aircraft to a customer by 2024 and to commercialize an air taxi service by 2025.
Joby's Marina, California pilot production plant, which operates in partnership with Toyota, has rolled out its first eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle) — made possible by a helpful $180 million injection from investor Baillie Gifford in May. The aircraft is Joby's first production prototype, and it means Joby is one step away from having a commercially viable eVTOL for passenger use.
The production prototype eVTOL — Joby's third full-scale prototype — also received a special airworthiness certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and can now begin flight testing.
“This first aircraft coming off our pilot manufacturing line is a really, really big deal for the company,” JoeBen Bevirt, founder and CEO of Joby, told TechCrunch. “We have spent many years building the processes and procedures and capabilities as an organization to be able to deliver this level of of aircraft. We've been building since 2017, but to be able to build with this level of rigor is a huge step forward. It prepares us for this next stage of the certification process.”
Joby has already flown over 30,000 miles since 2019 on pre-production prototype aircraft. This latest iteration builds on that experience and puts the company closer to achieving type certification with the FAA. Type certification means that the FAA approves of Joby's aircraft design and component parts, and that the design is compliant with the agency's standards for airworthiness and noise.
Joby nearly has three out of the five necessary stages of the type certification process underway, according to Bevirt. The final step after type certification would be production certification, which will allow Joby to mass produce eVTOLs under FAA-approved designs.
The eVTOL company already received its Part 135 air carrier certificate, which allows Joby to begin on-demand commercial air taxi operations, in May 2022.
Joby's production prototype aircraft has the potential to be the first eVTOL delivered to a customer, says the company. It will be deployed at Edwards Air Force Base in 2024, per Joby's Agility Prime contract with the U.S. Air Force, which is worth up to $131 million. To meet that deadline, Joby will have to work quickly with the Air Force in order to secure military airworthiness certification.
The design of that aircraft will be replicated at Joby's pilot manufacturing facility.
“We have multiple of these aircraft coming down the production line, and that will be what we'll be using both for customer applications and also for the type certification process,” said Bevirt.
Joby plans to commercialize an aerial rideshare service by 2025.
A deepening relationship with Toyota
Joby's pilot manufacturing line was built in partnership with Toyota. The Japanese automaker is Joby's largest external investor and will supply powertrains and actuation components to the company.
“Not only has Toyota invested almost $400 million in the company, they've also put a significant number of engineers on site with us working shoulder to shoulder here in California, as well as having a team of engineers back in Japan working on processes,” said Bevirt. “So when people come through our pilot manufacturing line, they can see the incredible technologies and systems that Toyota has brought to bear and help Joby learn about how to do manufacturing.”
The pilot manufacturing line gives Joby the capability to make tens of aircraft per year, said Bevirt. The next stage is building a “phase one manufacturing facility” that will allow Joby to build larger quantities of eVTOL. Bevirt didn't say where that manufacturing facility would be or when Joby hopes to break ground, but he did say the partnership with Toyota would be essential for that project, too.
In a move that deepens the relationship between the two companies, Joby also announced Wednesday that Tetsuo “Ted” Ogawa, president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, will join Joby's board of directors on July 1.
Ogawa has 39 years of experience at Toyota and currently leads Toyota North America as president and CEO, which runs 14 production plants in North America.
“As we look at scaling our manufacturing, we couldn't be more thrilled to have somebody of his stature joining the Joby board,” said Bevirt. “We think this really demonstrates Toyota's commitment to leading in this next stage of mobility.”
Aside from a manufacturer-investor relationship, Joby has worked with Toyota and Japanese airline ANA to explore ways to launch an air taxi service in Japan that connects to ground-based transportation.
Bevirt wouldn't say where Joby intends to commercialize air taxi operations first, but he did say that the company has been working closely with the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau, which Bevirt describes as “extremely forward leaning.”
“We'll be continuing to engage with them on our path to bringing the service to Japan,” he said.

","DoorDash is introducing a series of new features for users and delivery people on its platform, the company announced on Wednesday. Most notably, DoorDash is going to start giving delivery people the option to choose between two ways to earn.
“Earn by Time” is a new option that lets delivery people earn a guaranteed hourly minimum rate plus 100% of tips on top. DoorDash did not disclose what the hourly rate is. The second option is called “Earn Per Offer” and is the existing earning mode available on the platform, but with a more “efficient, streamlined suggest route,” DoorDash says. Delivery people who choose this way of earning will be shown upfront the guaranteed minimum amount they can expect to make plus 100% of tips.

“At the start of every dash where Earn by Time is available, Dashers can choose which earning mode they want to use and at any time, they can end their dash and start a new one in a different mode when available,” the company explained in a blog post. “With these two earning modes, Dashers today have unprecedented choice, flexibility, and control in how they dash.”
DoorDash is also making it possible for users to add a tip or increase the tip amount for their delivery person up to 30 days after the order has been fulfilled. Plus, a new “Dash Along the Way” feature will let delivery people automatically receive offers that take them directly to the zone they have selected as their trip's starting point. DoorDash is also letting delivery people now share their location with up to five of their trusted contacts, allowing them to see when they are on a delivery trip, if their delivery trip has ended or if 911 help has been requested.

As for customers, DoorDash is adding a new universal search bar at the top of the app that lets users search for anything they need across grocery and restaurants. The app is also adding new dedicated tabs for browsing, grocery and retail that are designed to make it easier for users to find exactly what they're looking for.
Another update will allow users to start multiple shopping carts in the app. In the past, you could only create one at a time and were unable to save unfinished carts. You can now view and manage all of your carts by tapping the cart icon in the top-right corner of the app. These consumer app updates will gradually roll out to consumers over the next few months across the US, Canada and Australia. 
DoorDash is also launching SNAP/EBT online payment on DoorDash for grocery delivery with multiple partners including ALDI, Albertsons, Safeway, Meijer and participating 7-Eleven stores.

","A new company is emerging out of stealth today with $35 million in funding and a plan to acquire and consolidate startups within the Salesforce ecosystem.
Unaric, as the company is called, has secured $25m in debt and $10m equity from various VCs, angels, and growth lenders, as it looks to bring together independent Salesforce-focused SaaS companies help them capture a larger chunk of the gargantuan market that has cropped up around Salesforce these past couple of decades.
Some companies have built megabucks businesses on top of Salesforce, including Salesforce-native DevOps platform Copado; Salesforce data backup platform OwnBackup; and lead-generation platform Qualified. Thousands of smaller companies have cropped up off the back of Salesforce's rise to the giddy heights of a $200 billion enterprise behemoth, creating an ecosystem that some estimates peg at four times that of Salesforce itself.
However, relatively few companies within that Salesforce ecosystem become massive in their own right, due in part to their narrowly-focused “point solutions” that mean end-users have to combine multiple different tools from various smaller vendors — something that larger enterprises are often reluctant to do. And this is where Unaric enters the fray.
“For enterprise customers it can be painful to purchase and manage small niche solutions,” Unaric co-founder and CEO James Gasteen explained to TechCrunch. “Unaric addresses this by building larger suites, which solve large problems for customers through a single vendor who can provide greater innovation, better service and global support.”
‘By founders, for founders'
Founded out of London in July last year, Unaric is aiming to buy up to 40 companies over the next three years, the first of which it's announcing today with the acquisition of Salesbolt, a product that automatically keeps CRM contacts up-to-date. Over time, Unaric says that it intends to increase the opportunity for cross-selling and knowledge-sharing across all Salesforce products under its wing, as well as introduce a “shared central infrastructure” including a product and engineering hub.
The Salesbolt deal pegs Unaric's initial focus firmly in the RevOps realm, an area Gasteen says it will double-down on.
“By acquiring multiple companies in this areas we will be able to drive cross-sales,” he said. “This is an area where we already have a pipeline of deals lined up. The next stage is to use our knowledge of industries and existing customers’ needs to build out suites of companies focused on particular industry sectors.”
Unari is the handiwork of James Gasteen and chief product officer Neil Crawford, each having previously founded Salesforce-ecosystem companies, and chair Peter Lindholm and CFO Moritz Birke. Gasteen, in fact, already has prior experience of merging two Salesforce-focused companies, when his previous startup Precursive acquired a “complementary” product called Taskfeed back in 2019.
“There is a mismatch in the Salesforce ISV (independent software vendor) ecosystem which we have experienced personally, and we know how to put it right,” Gasteen said. “We believe that by building suites of products that match more closely the needs of enterprises, we can help companies to significantly increase their sales, scale their businesses and sell to corporate buyers who would not normally buy from individual vendors.”
Such a hefty acquisition spree will, of course, require a lot of capital which is where Unaric's external funding comes into play. The $25 million debt segment emanates from Atempo Growth, with the remaining seed equity tranche coming from LocalGlobe, Concentric, FJ Labs, and angels such as OwnBackup founder Sam Gutmann; Hotjar founder Johan Malmberg; and enterprise software startup investor Dave Kellogg.
Longer term, Gasteen says that Unaric is looking to emulate the growth trajectory of a number of established enterprise software companies, such as Veeva Systems, a $32 billion life sciences software company; and Ncino, a $3 billion fintech. Both companies were initially built on top of Salesforce and embraced the cloud from the get-go, but more importantly they have focused their efforts on broad techstacks spanning a single sector.
“They have created a lot of value in the ecosystem through being focused on a single industry techstack,” Gasteen said. “They have built the companies mainly through product development and some M&A. Our idea is to emulate the success of these companies by building many Ncino’s and Veeva’s within Unaric.”

Astrix Security, which uses ML to secure app integrations, raises $25M by Kyle Wiggers originally published on TechCrunch
","Astrix Security, a platform that helps companies manage and secure third-party app integrations, today announced that it closed a $25 million Series A funding round led by CRV with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners and F2 Venture Capital.
Co-founder and CEO Alon Jackson says that the round, which brings Astrix's total raised to $40 million, will be put toward expanding headcount across the company's offices in Tel Aviv and U.S.
“The pandemic enforced cloud and software-as-a-service (SaaS) adoption, thus increasing third-party adoption and automation — requiring a solution to fit this digital and fast-paced interconnected world,” Jackson told TechCrunch in an email interview. “Astrix was founded to close a significant and unaddressed security gap by allowing security teams to extend access management and threat detection to the non-human identity layer.”
Jackson co-launched Astrix in 2021 alongside Idan Gour, who he met while serving in the Israel Defense Forces. Both say that they saw a need to create a platform that could help companies bring app integrations, which continue to gain in popularity, under firmer control from a security standpoint.
To their points, according to one recent report, company departments use between 40 and 60 different apps, with departments using an average of 200 apps organization-wide. This can amplify the security risk. Another poll, published in 2022 by the Ponemon Institute and Mastercard's RiskRecon, found that 54% of organizations were breached through third parties over the preceding 12 months.
“Apps are often connected by employees across departments without the security team’s knowledge, making having visibility and governance into every third-party connection virtually impossible,” Jackson said.
Astrix connects to a company's core systems — including SaaS, integration platform-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service — to attempt to protect against over-privileged and malicious third-party app connections that might expose an organization. Using machine learning-based behavioral analysis engines, Astrix tries to spot deviations from standard app-to-app connectivity behaviors and suggest remediation steps that security teams can take to address the root of the problem.

Beyond detecting threats, Astrix provides a view of all the internal and third-party integrations within a business environment, as well as all access keys in use (e.g. API keys and service accounts) and the permissions and level of access granted to each one.
James Green, a general partner at CRV, said that it was these holistic observability features that caught CRV's eye.
“Astrix is taking an innovative approach to extending identity and access management and threat detection to all non-human identities, giving unprecedented capabilities to manage the growing API-based third-party attack surface across all environments,” he said in an emailed statement.
Astrix isn't without rivals in the app connection security space, including Apiiro, which works to help developers and security operators find and solve app-related issues that could result in vulnerabilities. There's also Valence Security, Wing Security and Kodem, the last of which recently came out of stealth with $25 million in venture backing to tackle app security.
But Jackson, while declining to reveal the size of Astrix's customer base, noted that Astrix recently brought on high-profile customers including Figma, Priceline, Bloomreach and Rapyd.
“Cybersecurity is one of the few fields that is traditionally less impacted during down times,” Jackson said. “Moreover, layoffs and down markets create more cybercrime worldwide, and we've especially been experiencing this in the past year.”
That first point isn't necessarily true — Q1 marked lowest VC funding for security in a decade, according to one report. But it seems that Astrix is successfully bucking the trend.

","Fintech startup Bitpanda is splitting into two companies as Bitpanda Pro — the company’s cryptocurrency exchange — is going to become its own independent company called One Trading. As part of this move, One Trading is also raising $33 million (€30 million) in funding.
Peter Thiel’s Valar Ventures is leading the funding round with participation from MiddleGame Ventures, Speedinvest, Keyrock and Wintermute Ventures.
Bitpanda is a popular consumer trading app that has raised hundreds of millions of dollars and attracted millions of users in Europe. While the company started as a crypto broker and exchange, it then added the ability to buy and sell stocks, ETFs, precious metals like gold and commodities.
More recently, the company has been partnering with other fintech startups so that they can offer stock and crypto trading in their own apps. For instance, Lydia and N26 both selected Bitpanda as their white-label trading partner.
In addition to these trading products designed for retail investors, Bitpanda has been running its own crypto exchange called Bitpanda Pro. This service is designed for institutional investors who handle large orders or businesses that want to trade using bots and the company’s API.
And that’s the part of the business that is becoming its own company called One Trading. Going forward, Bitpanda is still going to offer crypto trading — but it will act as a broker, not an exchange. A crypto exchange manage trades between different users while a broker acts as an intermediary between customers and different markets.
One Trading CEO Joshua Barraclough, who was already in charge of Bitpanda Pro, said in an email that Bitpanda and Bitpanda Pro are “separating so that they can build out a market leading product for sophisticated retail and institutional customers, with the right focus and investment to be successful. Bitpanda continues to operate, but no longer has an exchange or institutional OTC business.”
Splitting the company also means that Bitpanda won’t face as many regulatory challenges as One Trading. For instance, One Trading plans to offer derivatives, which are risky financial assets.
Similarly, in the U.S., crypto companies like Coinbase and Binance are facing lawsuits for securities law violations. While the regulatory landscape seems more stable in Europe for now, things could change in the future. Isolating Bitpanda from the crypto exchange activities seems smart to guarantee Bitpanda’s long-term prospects.
So far, Bitpanda Pro hasn’t been the most active crypto exchange. As of this writing, CoinMarketCap reports that the platform has facilitated $634,000 in transaction volume over the past 24 hours. As a comparison, Binance and Coinbase have handled more than $8 billion and nearly $1 billion in transaction volume respectively.
One Trading hopes that it can improve liquidity with recent infrastructure improvements. “We aim to become a utility for large liquidity providers to exchange unlimited amounts of risk under a membership model instead of pay-per-trade and have low fees and deep books for retail with a number of liquidity protections,” Barraclough said in a statement.
“We will then start listing more products with appropriate controls and vetting as we move into derivatives. Above all we want a regulated, institutional-grade platform where people feel safe to trade with unique product options,” he added.
It’s going to be interesting to see if there is any significant change in transaction volume in the coming weeks.

","Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens has announced that she's stepping down, some five years after landing in the hotseat.
Founded out of the Netherlands back in 2010, Fairphone has set out to differentiate from other smartphone makers by focusing on sustainability and lowering its environmental footprint — this includes making its devices modular and thus easier to replace parts and minimizing its use of conflict minerals. The company has also expanded into tangential products including headphones and accessories, and has raised around $94 million in funding, including a $53 million tranche just give months ago.
Stepping down
Gouwens joined Fairphone first as managing director in 2017, before replacing the company's founder Bas van Abel the following year as CEO.
Quoting former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, Gouwens indicated that her reason for stepping down was simply to her running out of steam: “I know what this job takes, and I know I no longer have enough in the tank to do it justice. It’s as simple as that.”
At the time of writing, it appears that Fairphone has not yet found a successor, with today's announcement signalling the start of a search process to find the company's next CEO.
“Now I know it is the right time for me to find someone like-minded yet fresh to take my place,” Gouwens said. “Someone who understands Fairphone’s mission and vision. Someone who can help Fairphone scale even greater heights.”

","Gleamer, a five-year-old French startup that has developed AI software to help radiologists diagnose and detect bone trauma lesions in scans among other conditions, has raised €27 million ($29.5 million) in a Series B round of funding.
Founded in 2017, Gleamer's core flagship BoneView software, which it touts as an “AI companion for bone trauma x-rays,” helps direct radiologists to areas of a scan that might indicate anomalies that are easy to miss with the naked eye. It also develops ChestView for detecting pulmonary pathologies.
All of Gleamer's products have been certified for use in Europe, while BoneView has received FDA clearance in the U.S. The company claims some 6,500 users across 650 institutions in 24 countries.

Gleamer is seeking to capitalize on a growing demand for medical imaging services, driven in part by increasing chronic diseases, under-funded healthcare systems, and aging populations.
Just last week, the U.K. Government announced a new £21 million fund to extend AI deeper into the NHS, with a particular focus on medical imaging. Elsewhere, numerous startups have raised sizeable chunks of venture capital (VC) funding to bring new technologies and services to the radiology realm, including portable x-ray machines, private medical imaging marketplaces, and so-called “decision support” software powered by AI.
Paris-based Gleamer has now raised a total of €36 million since its inception, and with its latest cash injection it said that it plans to extend its product portfolio to include CT scans and mammography, and expand its team both in Europe and the U.S.
Gleamer's Series B round was co-led by Supernova Invest and Heal Capital, with participation from XAnge, Elaia, Bpifrance, F3A, MACSF, Crista Galli Ventures, UI Investissement, and “several European radiologists.”

Dear Sophie, 
Our startup employs about 30 people globally through a combination of direct and co-employment based on their country. 
Over the last year and a half or so, we helped several team members relocate from Ukraine and Russia to various non-Schengen countries such as Georgia, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. 
We realize it’s more expensive if we bring these employees to the U.S., but our startup will be more successful. How do we bring them here?
— Meaningful Money-making
Dear Meaningful,
Many companies have helped make a meaningful difference in people’s lives, supporting talented team members and their families from countries such as Ukraine and Russia to relocate to safety. Thank you for now considering how to help certain individuals relocate to the U.S. May all humans enjoy peace, prosperity, and freedom.
Many employers are continuing to work with the Ukrainian and Russian professionals who have left their homes since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Of the 8 million people who have left Ukraine, more than 270,000 have been admitted to the United States, most of them under the Uniting for Ukraine program, which provides a temporary stay in the United States and a work permit.
At least 500,000 and as many as 1 million people have left Russia and more than 65,000 Russians have sought entry to the U.S. between February 2022 and April 2023. According to Russian government figures, about 100,000 IT specialists (about 10 percent of the tech workforce) left Russia, which is likely underestimated.
Before I dive into options for bringing Ukrainian and Russian employees to the United States, I recommend you work with an immigration attorney to devise a strategy for each employee you’re seeking to sponsor based on her/his education, skills, qualifications, location, and situation. Your company has several options for bringing your Ukrainian and Russian employees to live and work in the United States.
Uniting for Ukraine
The Uniting for Ukraine program, which began last year, provides a way for Ukrainian citizens and their immediate family members to come to the United States to stay for two years under temporary parole status. Individuals participating in the program must have a U.S.-based supporter or multiple supporters—an individual, organization, or business—who agrees to financially support their stay.
The supporter must fill out Form I-134A (Online Request to be a Supporter and Declaration of Financial Support) and submit it to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The program includes the option for a Employment Authorization Document (EAD), otherwise known as a work permit.
Right now, parole under the Uniting for Ukraine program cannot be extended beyond two years, but that may change. Your company could consider sponsoring employees on parole for work visas or green cards I explain in more detail below.Ask Sophie: How do we relocate Ukrainian and Russian team members to the U.S.? by Walter Thompson originally published on TechCrunch

","A couple of months after unveiling Proton Pass, Proton — the company behind end-to-end encrypted email service Proton Mail — is officially launching its password manager to everyone. As a reminder, Proton Pass is an end-to-end encrypted password manager for individuals and (soon) families.
Everybody should use a password manager as it helps you use a different, sophisticated password for every website and service where you have an account. This way, when a service faces a data breach, your online accounts remain relatively safe. You can change your password on the targeted site and move on.
There are several options when it comes to password managers. Some enterprise-grade password managers like 1Password and Dashlane offer many features, such as the ability to store documents and receive security alerts when there’s a new data breach that could affect you.
Web browsers, such as Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, also have their own built-in password managers. They are more limited than dedicated products, but they are free. Apple’s operating systems (macOS, iOS, etc.) also offer a built-in password manager that works really well for people who like Apple’s ecosystem.
I played around with a beta version of Proton Pass, and it offers all the basic features that you would expect from a password manager. It’s available as a browser extension on desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Brave) and the company also has mobile apps for iOS and Android.
When you browse the web on desktop, Proton Pass takes over from the default password manager in your browser. For instance, if you sign in to your email account, Proton Pass will prompt you to save your credentials in Proton’s password manager. If you create a new account, Proton Pass can generate a unique password for you.
On the iPhone, Proton Pass can be used to autofill passwords in Safari and mobile apps. Your logins and passwords are automatically synchronized with across devices.
Everything you store in Proton Pass is end-to-end encrypted, including passwords (obviously), but also email addresses, URLs and notes. Proton itself cannot decrypt your user data as they don’t have your user key.
The company plans to open source Proton Pass so that security experts can verify the security model. There will be security audits, security reports and a bug bounty program as well.
In addition to login information, Proton Pass users can store generation codes for one-time passwords so that the password manager can become their two-factor authenticator. Users can also create notes for sensitive information that aren’t related to online services, such as credit card information and social security numbers.
Proton Pass is the result of the acquisition of SimpleLogin, an email alias startup as the SimpleLogin team worked on Proton Pass. Proton is taking advantage of SimpleLogin’s existing product as users can create email aliases if they don’t want to share their real email address. Incoming emails are redirected to their Proton Mail inbox. If you don’t need that alias anymore, you can delete it and the email alias will stop working.
Overall, Proton Pass doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of 1Password, but it’s a solid password manager. A native desktop app would be nice. Credit card autofilling would be useful too. But the basic version of Proton Pass is free with support for multiple devices.
Users can also get a premium subscription, which includes unlimited email aliases instead of 10 and the two-factor authentication feature I mentioned earlier. It will soon also include the ability to create shared vaults so that users can safely share passwords with family members and friends. If you’re already a Proton subscriber, the premium features for Proton Pass are included in Proton’s Unlimited and Family plans. Otherwise, the premium version of Proton Pass will cost $2.99 to $4.99 per month based on the subscription length.
If you are using Proton Mail as your main email address, Proton Pass could be particularly compelling as the email alias feature integrates seamlessly with your Proton Mail email address. Proton Pass could also quickly become a way to attract new users to the Proton ecosystem with its free offering. The company recently surpassed 100 million user accounts.

","The U.S. is weighing additional restrictions on AI chip export to China amid rising concerns over the use of advanced semiconductors for military modernization.
The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Commerce could prohibit shipments of chips from manufacturers including Nvidia to customers in China as soon as early next month.
The latest move is part of the U.S.'s broader strategy to limit China's progress in AI, particularly in the military sphere. However, these measures are also having an adverse impact on the commercial AI sector in China, where many firms operate with teams that span both the U.S. and China.
The development is an update to the export controls implemented in September, which limited the sale of Nvidia's cutting-edge A100 and H100 chips, designed for high-performance computing, to China. In response, Nvidia came up with a less powerful AI chip, the A800, as a workaround to the export restrictions. But now even this chip might be subject to further restrictions, potentially requiring an export license before shipping to China, according to the WSJ report.
Nvidia declined to comment on the report.
As large language models such as GPT-4 continue to drive up the demand for computational power, Chinese tech firms have been stockpiling Nvidia's AI chips in anticipation. ByteDance, for instance, is reported to have placed orders for over $1 billion worth of GPUs from Nvidia this year, per a report by Chinese outlet LatePost.
According to Reuters, the banned A100 is sold for as much as $20,000 a piece on the black market in China, double the regular price.
The U.S. government is also considering limiting the leasing of cloud services to Chinese AI companies, the WSJ reported. This would deal a blow to the Chinese firms that are using such arrangements to circumvent the chip bans. But the broad definition of “AI companies” could potentially result in collateral damage to a great number of Chinese tech companies caught in the crossfire of the ongoing chip war.
In their global expansion, Chinese companies often choose American cloud providers over homegrown options like Alibaba or Tencent, as Western regulators grow increasingly wary of Chinese services. Limiting access to U.S. cloud services could make it difficult for Chinese firms to meet local data storage regulations, adding even more complication to their expansion plans.

","Bluu Seafood, a German company creating cultivated (i.e. “lab-grown”) fish products, today announced it has raised €16 million ($17.5 million) in a Series A round of funding.
Founded out of Berlin in 2020 originally as Bluu Biosciences, Bluu Seafood starts with a “one-time” fish biopsy — which, it says, doesn't require killing any fish — and then uses stem-cell technology to grow entire cell lines (i.e. fish species) inside a lab.
The company unveiled its first products last August, including a line of fish sticks (or “fish fingers”) and fish balls. These are made from cultivated fish cells that are enriched with plant proteins, a process it says helps make their mouth-feel and cooking process more realistic.

Production problems
Bluu Seafood is one of numerous biotech startups that are setting out to address the world’s seafood production problems, which includes overfishing, contamination, and cruelty. But the movement is not limited to marine animals, with countless companies raising bucketloads of VC cash to reproduce everything from bacon to burgers and chicken and beyond.
Bluu Seafood, for its part, had raised €7.1 million in funding so far, and with another €16 million in the bank it's now gearing up to attain regulatory approval in various markets, including Singapore which is currently the only market in the world where cultured meat (chicken) is available to buy. However, the Food and Drug Association (FDA) also started rubberstamping such edibles as being safe for human consumption, and just this week it approved two companies to begin selling their lab-grown chicken products — so we can expect some commercial activity in the U.S. in the very near future.
First up, Bluu Seafood is aiming to enter Singapore, where it says it expects to receive approval some time in 2024, while it says it has also kickstarted the approval process with the FDA, and will then set about targeting the European market.
Bluu Seafood's Series A round was led by Sonae-subsidiary Sparkfood and LBBW VC, with participation from Delivery Hero, SeaX Ventures, Manta Ray Ventures, Norrsken VC,  Hamburgische Investitions- und Förderbank and Dr. Oetker.

","Meet Flowie, a new French startup that wants to facilitate money movements between companies. The company centralizes everything related to accounts receivable and accounts payable so that everyone in the company can see relevant information when it comes to getting paid by clients and receiving money from suppliers.
Flowie was started by Yann Ravel-Sibillot, Rémi Legorrec and Aurélie Hadida. In particular, the company’s CEO already has plenty of experiences when it comes to managing invoices at scale. He was the CTO of Big Mamma and worked on Sunday, a fast restaurant checkout flow.
With this new startup, the Flowie team wants to improve how companies handle invoices. Flowie acts as a central repository for all your transactional data.
It connects with all your existing tools, such as the ERP system that holds your contracts, order numbers, receipt slips, etc. Flowie also integrates with your CRM so that you can get some context about the relationship with a client or a supplier. Finally, it also connects with your bank account so that it can see if you received a payment and initiate new payments.
For instance, when you receive an invoice from a supplier, usually the person in charge of accounting doesn’t really know if they’re supposed to pay this supplier. Maybe your company never received what you paid for.
Instead of having an internal conversation and creating friction, anybody can validate transactions on Flowie. The platform automatically tries to fetch information from the invoice and people in the company can add files to provide context.
When a transaction is approved, you can either choose to pay it now or pay it at some point in the future. If you schedule a future payment, you can notify your supplier that the payment has been scheduled and there’s no need to get back to you about that pending invoice.
On the other side of the equation, when it comes to accounts receivables, companies can upload an invoice on Flowie. It is converted into an e-invoice with a QR code. Clients can click on a link and see different payment methods. They can pay with a bank transfer, a card payment or a direct debit. Flowie also lets you offer early payment discounts.
It’s still early days for the startup. The company has raised a bit of money from business angels and there are 11 people working on the product. But the company has already tracked hundreds of millions of euros in invoices on its platform.

","Amazon subsidiary Zoox has begun testing its purpose-built, electric, autonomous robotaxis on public streets in Las Vegas, the company announced Tuesday. Zoox says this marks the first time that an autonomous vehicle built without pedals or a steering wheel has operated on public roads in Nevada.
Zoox is starting small with a one-mile loop around the neighborhood where its Las Vegas facilities are located in the southwest region of the city, with plans to expand in the coming months. The initial route will test Zoox's robotaxi on several unprotected turns and multi-way stops, as well as its ability to navigate roads with cyclists, pedestrians and other cars, according to a blog post.
The robotaxis, which can transport four people at a time at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour, will be available to Zoox employees during workday hours.
Zoox did not specify how many vehicles it will have on the roads or during what hours of operation it will provide this initial robotaxi service. But a company spokesperson did say there will be “multiple” Zoox vehicles testing.
The company said it has been driving on public roads in Vegas since June 16, 2023, and has been in the city for much longer. The company expanded operations to Las Vegas to test, validate and refine its technology in 2019 with an eye toward launching commercial operations there in the future. The company used a test fleet of Toyota Highlanders to map the area and gather data, while driving autonomously with safety drivers on board.
In 2020, Zoox opened an office and depot in Vegas to support its test fleet. The company is now expanding those operations and adding 190,000 square feet of warehouse and office space for its vehicles and its growing team in the region. The company's workforce, which is spread between several locations in California, Nevada and Washington, has grown from 1,900 employees to 2,200 since the beginning of the year, the company confirmed. The bulk of new hires in Las Vegas are for its “mission readiness” team, which is focused on fleet maintenance and charging.
The Vegas launch follows Zoox's deployment on public roads in Foster City, California, in February. Zoox, which holds a driverless testing permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles, is also transporting employees there. The company has yet to open up its vehicles to the public.
Nevada is a much easier state in which to test AVs than California, which has a rigorous permitting process overseen by the California DMV. Nevada allows all automation levels to operate on public streets and its DMV doesn't test or certify vehicles.
Zoox said in a tweet that it had been given authorization from Nevada's DMV to operate its robotaxi autonomously. According to Nevada law, AV companies that want to develop and test vehicles in the state need to self-certify that vehicles meet the Nevada “minimal risk condition” to be able to stop if there is a malfunction in the system.

In a wise and shrewdly open-ended exception to this prohibition, the Grammy authorities allow for any work in which “the human authorship component of the work submitted must be meaningful and more than de minimis.” Furthermore, the authorship must pertain to the category a song is submitted for (e.g., for “songwriting” the AI cannot have written the song).
What does this all mean? Say you used an AI-powered tool to generate a constantly shifting loop of some instruments you played. You layer this in with the drums, recorded instruments, and record the vocals you wrote on top. No problem here! The AI is basically just a tool or effect, like any pedal or filter.
But what if you had the AI generate the lyrics from a prompt, then sing them in the style of David Crosby? Then you have Riffusion put together some beats and instrumentation. Last, layer in some unique generated tones you shifted from Brian Eno's Reflection.
Now, regardless of the quality of the result (and at a guess . . . not great), no one would say that you had no creative hand in the resulting track. But were you the songwriter, the vocalist, the composer, or the instrumentalist? Not as those terms are commonly understood or credited. And certainly not according to the folks setting the rules over at the Grammys.
This policy of excluding pure AI works but allowing it to be used as a tool is probably the best way forward for awards like this. We've seen already how malicious actors can flood publishers with AI-generated writing, hoping to snatch a paid spot or even just notoriety. Deepfakes and AI-generated video are already starting to creep onto streaming platforms. Music is likewise vulnerable to disruption by those who would abuse AI technology instead of use it creatively.
Generative music, it must be said, is more than simply valid — it's practically a genre of its own now. And the creation of some of its most iconic works could be described as simplistic (even by their own creators). But it seems unlikely that the Grammys would reject Eno's Music For Airports if it was submitted today, since it seems clear that there is “meaningful” human authorship involved. But they wouldn't allow three minutes of randomly selected Generative.fm or Kriller tracks.
The policy is, as I said, wisely open-ended, allowing for the organization to exercise its judgment in what they define as “lacking significance or importance; so minor as to merit disregard.” No doubt this definition will be in flux in years to come as major artists embrace, reject, or grudgingly include AI-powered tools in their creative processes.

From DrakeGPT to Infinite Grimes, AI-generated music strikes a chord

","ChatGPT on mobile can now surf the web. But only via Bing.
Today, OpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus, the premium version of the company's AI-powered chatbot, can use a new feature on the ChatGPT app called Browsing to have ChatGPT search Bing for answers to questions.
Browsing can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting “GPT-4” in the model switcher and choosing “Browse with Bing” from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.
OpenAI says that Browsing is particularly useful for queries relating to current events and other information that “extend[s] beyond [ChatGPT's] original training data.” When Browsing is disabled, ChatGPT's knowledge cuts off in 2021.
Browsing — which Microsoft and OpenAI previously announced would arrive sometime this year, first on the web — certainly makes ChatGPT a more useful assistant, particularly for research. Prior to it, asking ChatGPT questions like “Who won the 2023 March Madness women's tournament?” wouldn't yield anything particularly useful — or correct.
But limiting ChatGPT's search capabilities to Bing seems just short of a user-hostile move. The business motivations are obvious — OpenAI has a close partnership with Microsoft, which has invested over $10 billion in the startup — but Bing is far from the be-all and end-all of search engines.
Back in 2011, an analysis found that Bing was potentially unfairly serving more Microsoft-related results than Google links. More recently, a Stanford study showed evidence that Bing's top search results contained an “alarming” amount of disinformation.
Microsoft undoubtedly continues to improve Bing's algorithms on the back end. But the problem with ChatGPT's new Browsing feature is, when Bing inevitably slips up, users won't have any alternatives to choose from.
In other, less controversial ChatGPT app news, tapping on a search result now takes you directly to the respective point in the conversation. That change — along with Browsing — is rolling out this week, OpenAI says.

Mercedes brings F1 technology to the AMG S 63 E Performance by Emme Hall originally published on TechCrunch
","“Win on Sunday, sell on Monday.” That was the popular marketing adage when motorsports and car sales were intricately intertwined. While a podium finish these days doesn't necessarily translate into a bump in sales — with many consumers being more focused on fuel economy, looks and comfort — there is still a glimmer of truth to the phrase.
Take the new Mercedes-AMG S 63 E Performance hybrid, for instance. That's a mouthful of a name to be sure, but Mercedes takes advantage of the battery technology in its podium-winning F1 car driven by Lewis Hamilton and George Russell to give us the most powerful S-Class ever. I'm talking 802 horsepower and a whopping 1,055 pound-feet of torque — in a luxury sedan.
The S 63 E Performance is a plug-in hybrid (not a BEV like the Mercedes EQS SUV). But don't think you'll get any kind of efficiency out of the powertrain. The 13.1 kWh battery only lasts for about 20 miles of all-electric range). Instead the battery, like that found in the Mercedes F1 car, is designed for maximum performance with high-capacity charging and discharging.
F1 battery technology, explained
Image Credits: Mercedes-Benz
The S 63 E Performance uses the same kind of lithium-ion cells as the race car and every one of the 1,200 cells is cooled individually by 3.7 gallons of a high-tech coolant. It starts in the bottom of the battery and is pumped around each cell to the top with a high-performance electric pump. It then passes through a heat exchanger, on to a low-temperature circuit and then finally to a cooler where the heat is released into the outside air. That results in a battery that remains at a constant 113 degrees Fahrenheit and stays primed for optimum performance, even if ambient temperatures are Montana-in-winter freezing or Death Valley hot.
This isn't the first time Mercedes has employed this technology; it's also featured in the rowdy AMG C 63 S E Performance and the AMG GT 63 S E Performance. Though the power delivery is just as quick on these models, the batteries have a capacity of 6.1 kWh and 6.7 kWh, respectively.
Image Credits: Emme Hall
The S 63 has a unique operating strategy as well. The car can be driven in all-electric mode, but once the battery dwindles down to 25% or so capacity, it switches to Comfort mode to save a bit of battery should the driver want to spend some electrons carving some back country roads at full-bore. Other PHEVs allow drivers to knock the battery all the way down to nothing if they want. By always keeping some juice in the battery, the car is always primed for performance driving.
Fun times are available in every driving mode, accessed by what the company calls “kick down.” Think of it as a heavy space in the throttle. Everything above that space is easy cruising, but push your foot past and you're rewarded with all the beans, no matter which drive mode you're in.
When powering up from home the battery can only accept a charge of 3.6 kW, which is extraordinarily slow. However, the AMG-ified S-Class makes up for it with on-the-go charging. When driving in Sport or Sport+ modes the gas engine can supply 90 kW of power to the battery, and it can even accept surges of up to 140 kW on extremely heavy braking. The S 63 E Performance has four levels of regenerative braking, and though it never brings the car to a complete stop, the computer always defaults to regenerative braking and it keeps some regen even during mechanical braking or when drivers hit the limit and move into ABS.
Drive like Lewis
Image Credits: Mercedes-Benz
My day with the car starts with a leisurely drive on the Pacific Coast Highway in EV mode, which is accessed at the top end of the throttle.
The result is a sublime ride with smooth gear changes and little to no road and tire noise entering the cabin. Once I get to the hills behind Malibu, I appreciate that the car has saved some go-go beans for me as these canyons are begging to be carved.
I switch to Sport mode, press through the kickdown and I've reached 60 miles per hour in less than three and a half seconds. A sharp left hand turn is quickly approaching so I go heavy on the brakes and this 5,000-plus pound vehicle slows admirably with nary a twitch and without losing grip. I can feel the heft in the turns and despite the rear steering, the sensation is one of manhandling a wild stallion around a barrel. Yet somehow it still feels composed and agile. I guess this is what a luxury wild stallion feels like.
Mercedes' in-car tech

There are pages in the MBUX infotainment system that tell me how much power I'm putting back into the battery with my braking, but my eyes are focused ahead on the next corner. I love how the nine-speed automatic transmission downshifts on braking, always putting me in the correct gear for corner exit, aided by the full force of the electric motor. This gal may be heavy, but she sure is fun.
I love the large 12.8-inch OLED center screen running Mercedes' MBUX infotainment system. It defaults to the navigation screen and I can choose to overlay small shortcut icons to most-used features. Mercedes uses an augmented reality system when it comes to navigation, overlaying arrows on a video feed from the forward facing camera. It's pretty trick.
Of course, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are here if you want to go old-school, but the Mercedes nav system is really good.
The 12.3-inch gauge cluster is similarly cool, with nifty 3D effects and plenty of ways to customize the layout. The head-up display can offer up as much information as you could possibly need and then some. I find it to be more distracting than anything else, but other drivers may find it useful.
Not your average hybrid layout
Image Credits: Mercedes-Benz
The hybrid system of the S 63 E Performance is also unique, although it doesn't come from F1. In many hybrids, power from both the gas-powered engine and the electric motor go through the same transmission. Engineers call this a P2 hybrid. However, as good as the Mercedes transmission is, it's not strong enough to handle the combined 1,055 pound-feet of torque. Enter the P3 hybrid.
Here the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 engine under the hood feeds its power into the nine-speed automatic while the electric motor, positioned on the rear axle, has its own two-speed transmission. Granted, that transmission stays in first gear most of the time, but at just under 90 miles per hour it shifts to second gear to ensure maximum torque all the up to the car's top speed of 155 miles per hour.
The electric motor can also send variable amounts of power to the front wheels when driving in low-traction situations like rain or snow. Other hybrids, in addition to being of the P2 category, feature a fixed front to rear power distribution ratio. Further, by having the electric motor and transmission on the rear axle, the S 63 E Performance puts more weight on the back of the car for better weight distribution and ultimately, better handling.
S 63 E Performance interior: Best. Pillow. Ever.

Of course, none of this matters to me when I hand piloting duties over to my drive partner and test out the back seat. This is, after all, an S-Class with all the luxury features therein. With the push of a button the front passenger seat moves far forward and a foot rest extends from the rear seat. The seat back reclines and I can rest my head on the softest, most comforting pillow ever to touch my weary head. If Mercedes made these available for purchase I would gladly fork over plenty of greenbacks to take one of these pillows home. It's like resting your head on a dozen soft and fluffy kittens — except without smooshing them.
The rear seats, like the front, feature heating and cooling as well as massage. There's also a cooler in back here to keep beverages nice and frosty as well as a small tablet to control the MBUX infotainment system.
It is from here, lazing in the back seat, that I tell Mercedes' natural language AI assistance that I'm cold. She complies by turning down the air conditioning. Ask her what she thinks of BMW or Audi and she may offer you a snarky come back. But not too snarky — her programmers are, after all, German.
When I give the car back to Mercedes at the end of the day my tummy is still fluttering with the rush of over 1,000 pound-feet of twist that has pushed me back against the seat all day. It's not likely I'll get to experience a car like this any time soon, let alone buy one for myself.
Mercedes has not announced pricing but the standard S 580e plug-in hybrid starts at $120,000 or so and one can easily add $30,000 in options. With all this fancy tech added to the AMG S 63 E Performance, I wouldn't be surprised if we see a starting price of $160,000 or above.
If you're hoping for a $7,500 federal tax credit to soften the blow, you're out of luck. Currently only electrified cars that cost less than $55,000 are eligible for that nice little perk. However, you may still find state and local incentives of which to take advantage.
California residents are not eligible to slap the coveted carpool lane sticker on their AMG S 63 E Performance as it doesn't have enough all-electric range. However, requirements vary by state so again, check your local laws.
Look for it in dealerships at the end of this year.

","Faraday Future has managed to raise $90 million from existing investors to help it get its much-delayed FF 91 luxury electric SUV to production and delivery. Faraday's investors will also accelerate an existing commitment of $15 million, the EV company said Tuesday.
Faraday is one of a litany of EV SPACs — EV startups that went public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company — that has struggled to stay afloat. The company keeps burning through cash and putting its hand out for more, while pushing the delivery date of its vehicles. Against that backdrop, Faraday Future has also been investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, and suffered through one internal drama after another.
Despite repeated production delays and an inability to deliver vehicles into customers' hands, Faraday in May announced that its luxury EVs would have ChatGPT capabilities, an attempt to jump on the AI bandwagon and attract attention. And perhaps it worked, because the company, which as of April only had $30 million to its name, now has somehow managed to convince investors to give it millions more.
Per an SEC filing, Faraday's latest funds will be led by private equity firm ATW Partners with participation from Senyun International.
The company, which said in May that it hopes to raise $100 million in debt to support initial deliveries, will continue to seek additional funding sources. Faraday Future had planned to begin deliveries of its FF 91 Futurist at the end of May but needed to secure “substantial additional financing” first. It's not clear if those deliveries have begun, and Faraday didn't reply in time to TechCrunch to comment.
Shares popped 5%, or a whole penny, after the news, but have since dropped back down. Faraday's stock closed at $0.24 on Tuesday.
Faraday's funding comes as peer EV SPAC Lordstown Motors files for bankruptcy protection and sues its investor and manufacturing partner Foxconn for failing to make good on its investment commitments.

As Lordstown immolates, SPAC deals that didn't go to zero feel like the exception

The social network might not stop at just replacing the logo. Musk said the company will eventually “bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds.”
Late Sunday, Musk changed his profile picture to the new Twitter logo. Twitter's official account @Twitter has also changed its name and display picture to the new X logo.

In a reply to a user, Musk also hinted that people should refer to Tweets as “X's.”


x’s
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 24, 2023

The company's CEO Linda Yaccarino tweeted that while Twitter changed the way people conversed with each other, X will go further and will have features “centered in audio, video, messaging, payment/banking” and make it a “global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.” That sounds like a lot of things.


X is the future state of unlimited interactivity – centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking – creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities. Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine.

Musk's obsession with the letter ‘X' is well known. He founded X.com back in 1997, which eventually became PayPal. His space startup SpaceX has ‘X' as the logo. And most recently, he founded an AI company called X.ai. In April, the Musk-owned social network changed its legal name from Twtter Inc. to X Corp.
This is not the first time Musk is changing the Twitter logo. Earlier this year, he briefly changed the social network's logo to the Doge meme. A developer who had made an extension to avoid the doge logo said it also works for the new “X” logo — so you can restore the bird logo quickly.


Want the little blue bird back on #Twitter? I wrote this for avoiding the Dogecoin logo previously, but it also works for X-avoidance.

This new, optional subscription brings additional security features for users who have a lot of crypto assets or who are really concerned about security in general — basic accounts remain free and the app has also been redesigned.
As a reminder, ZenGo is a self-custodial wallet that uses multi-party computation. Unlike Metamask, a ZenGo wallet can’t be recovered using a seed phrase. This is important if you want to avoid phishing attempts. And unlike centralized exchanges like Coinbase, ZenGo doesn’t control your cryptocurrencies.
If you want to initiate a transaction from your ZenGo wallet, all parties need to approve the transaction. In that case, the secret share stored on your device and the secret share stored on ZenGo’s server are required.
If you lose your phone or it stops working, you can recover your ZenGo wallet on a new phone using the recovery file that is stored in one of your online cloud storage account, such as iCloud Drive or Dropbox. You also need to confirm the action from your email inbox and scan your face — more on that later.
And things have been working well for ZenGo as the company managed to attract more than one million downloads. Overall, ZenGo users have processed more than $1 billion in transaction volume.
“But what we've learned over the years is that there were plenty of use cases for which security had not been solved,” co-founder and CEO Ouriel Ohayon told me.
“What we've decided to do is launch a suite of security services called ZenGo Pro, which is a paid subscription that brings these innovations to all blockchains. This could be solved by certain services on certain blockchains, but in our case it's bundled.”
Biometric withdrawal protection and legacy transfer
In particular, ZenGo has identified two pain points that are rarely tackled by crypto wallets. First, what happens if someone steals your phone? As The Wall Street Journal already reported, if someone has access to your phone and knows your passcode, they can easily steal money from your financial apps and ruin your digital life.
With ZenGo Pro, users can enable another layer of security for outgoing transactions. When you first create your ZenGo wallet, the company scans your face and stores a 3D scan of your face. This isn’t FaceID — it uses FaceTec’s software technology for that feature.
ZenGo Pro users can require a face scan for outgoing transaction. This way, even if your roommate knows your passcode, they can’t empty your wallet behind your back. And if you’re trying to send money to a scam, ZenGo will also warn you with a new risk assessment system (a so-called “web3 firewall”).
Second, ZenGo is going to introduce a legacy transfer feature in the coming weeks. “The problem with inheritance is simple. What happens if you die — physically or digitally?” Ohayon said. “There are extremely costly solutions involving lawyers or notaries.”
With ZenGo Pro, the company wants to create a software solution that is easier to set up. A user can invite someone they trust to become their legacy contact. The other person should install ZenGo first. Both users will then get a shared secret that they can store on an online storage service like Dropbox.
After a pre-defined inactivity phase, crypto assets are automatically transferred to the legacy contact. The maximum inactivity setting is 24 months without opening the app at least once.
And yes, if the user dies and the ZenGo Pro subscription can’t be renewed because the payment method doesn’t work anymore, ZenGo will still transfer the assets after the inactivity phase.
In the future, ZenGo also plans to add additional features to its pro subscription. Paid users can also reach out to customer support more easily. The legacy system will be improved as well with the ability to add several contacts and define a split.
“Most wallet companies have business models that have shown their limits – including Ledger and including us until now. How do you create a revenue stream that is recurring, that is predictable, that aligns interests with the user interests without artificially trying to add fees here and there?” Ohayon said.
And this is key to understanding ZenGo Pro. Many crypto companies generate more revenue when there is more trading activity. This creates some seasonality and it can be more difficult to survive during crypto winters.
That’s probably also the reason why ZenGo has secured additional fundings from new and existing investors — but the company isn’t sharing the amount raised other than “millions of dollars.” Yat Siu, the CEO of Animoca Brands, is investing in the crypto wallet for the first time.
“Because creating a wallet is expensive. Here, we bring an innovative business model that enables us to create a recurring, sustainable model controlled by the wallet company,” Ohayon said.

The startup, which has raised about $250 million altogether and counts Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman among its backers, said it's rolling out its identity technology as well as the token internationally. Individuals can download World App, the startup's protocol-compatible wallet software, and visit an Orb, the startup's helmet-shaped eyeball-scanning verification device, to receive their World ID.
As TechCrunch has previously noted, Worldcoin is perhaps one of the most audacious efforts to bribe the world to embrace their currency. The startup, founded by OpenAI CEO Altman and Alex Blania, wants to put a crypto wallet (and some of their currency) onto every human’s smartphone, but in order to do so they have to build a way to determine whether someone is a unique human.
Worldcoin, in the works for over three years, has been quietly signing up individuals in many countries, including India, giving those onboarding 25 Worldcoin tokens. But the journey so far hasn't been very smooth. The project has received criticism for exploitative practices in poor countries. Between May 2021 and July 2023, more than 2 million individuals verified their World IDs at an Orb across more than 30 different countries, the startup said.

Worldcoin's website outlines its key potential applications: fortifying incentive strategies like coupons and loyalty programs traditionally susceptible to fraud, combatting bots through identity confirmation, and facilitating a globally democratic governance mechanism.
Worldcoin is holding about 20% of all its tokens, which are not launching in the U.S. for now. For the first 15 years, the startup is capping the total supply to 10 billion “WLD” tokens, it said. (More on this below.) At launch on Monday, the maximum circulating supply of the token, which is ERC-20 based, is 143 million, Worldcoin writes in a whitepaper.
“If successful, we believe Worldcoin could drastically increase economic opportunity, scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans for AI online while preserving private, enable global democratic processes, and eventually show a potential path to AI-funded UBI,” said the statement in a statement.
Worldcoin is an “attempt at global scale alignment,” it said, prompting a jab from Jack Dorsey, Twitter co-founder and no stranger to the world of cryptocurrency, who found it “cute.”

General Motors, which owns Cruise, submitted a petition in February 2022 to NHTSA to deploy up to 2,500 of the Cruise Origins annually without human controls and may soon have an answer.
At a congressional level, lawmakers will host a hearing on July 26 aimed at reviving long-delayed legislation on the safe and regulated adoption of self-driving cars. The panel will consider separate draft legislation from Representative Bob Latta (R-OH) and Representative Debbie Dingell (D-MI).
The hearing will be convened by a House subcommittee titled “Self-Driving Vehicle Legislative Framework: Enhancing Safety, Improving Lives and Mobility, and Beating China.” That last bit is important. American industry for decades has used the threat of some other great superpower gaining the upper hand as a narrative to drive forward technological progress, for better or worse.

Before we dive in, a quick highlight of my TechCrunch+ story this week that looks into Tesla’s stock price, which has dropped about 10% since the company reported Q2 earnings (more on that below), and why it’s priced as a tech company when its margins scream automaker.

Some more grim news from VanMoof as the e-bike darling that was venture backed to the tune of $189.1 million filed for bankruptcy. VanMoof is considering a third-party sale so that its activities can continue. Those activities being the highly customized parts and the unique digital unlock key that’s connected to VanMoof’s servers. We reported that Cowboy came up with an app to let VanMoof owners retail digital keys to their bikes, but the access is limited.
TechCrunch how the company managed to go bankrupt in a booming e-bike market. One industry insider told us that VanMoof spent big on marketing and over-ordering and neglected to think about supply chain and unit costs.
As TC’s Ingrid Lunden pointed out: “If the unit economics of the bikes never worked out, and an app can be built in a day to unlock those bikes that are in the market already, why would anyone want to assume the assets of the failed startup?”
In other news…
Bird is officially back in compliance with the NYSE.
London-based bike-share HumanForest has launched a new feature, Forest Parcel, to provide a zero-emission, on-demand parcel-delivery service.
Taur, the front-facing scooter manufacturer, has launched its second model, the Taur II, on Kickstarter. The scooter has up to 40 miles of range.
Taur also started a campaign to challenge the U.K. government on their stance on owned scooters, which are still illegal to ride on public roads. There are, however, shared scooter pilots, which often serve to sway government and public opinion away from scooters as a viable transportation option due to the behavior of renters and potential for street clutter. The company said it would reimburse the fines of any Taur customer who is fined by the police for riding on U.K. roads. And if the scooter is confiscated, Taur will replace it free of charge.
Commsignia launched a V2X device for e-bikes and other micromobility vehicles that broadcasts messages about the cyclist’s position and direction from other road users. It also receives messages from other vehicles and alerts the rider to potential hazards.
Deal of the week

Autonomous vehicle company Aurora Innovation has sold $820 million worth of stock. About $220 million came from a public offering that priced the stock at $3 per share, and the remaining $600 million came from a concurrent private offering of stock priced at $2.70.
Aurora, a pre-revenue company building frontier technology, has been spending a pretty penny in its pursuit of commercializing self-driving trucks by the end of 2024. In 2022, the company lost about $1.7 billion.
Aurora hasn’t been shy about its need to raise more funds in order to make it to commercialization and beyond. The company said it has about $785 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30, 2023. This infusion of capital gives Aurora another $1.6 billion to play around with. The company is hoping the funds will take it “well into 2025.”
Other deals that got my attention…

Notable news and other tidbits

ADAS
Mobileye has introduced a vision-only speed assist solution for automakers. The camera-based Intelligent Speed Assist is launching in production vehicles this year and lets cars sense speed limits without needing to rely on third-party map and GPS data.
Autonomous vehicles
Cruise’s full-page ad in several newspapers calling humans terrible drivers got the attention of the former NHTSA head. “Using the pain and suffering of those deaths for self-promotion of an unproven and unsafe product is unscrupulous,” said Joan Claybrook.
Speaking of Cruise, the company has officially started initial robotaxi testing in Miami.
Another Cruise-related issue. The California Public Utilities Commission — the agency that has the power to give Cruise and Waymo final sign-off on their plans to expand commercial robotaxi services across San Francisco 24/7 — will question the two companies over how they will deal with robotaxis malfunctioning and blocking access from first responders. The July 31 meeting, which will also hear from city agencies that are opposed to the expansion, might change the terms of the permits.
Kodiak Robotics is working with Drivewyze to launch a weigh station program for self-driving trucks on Texas interstates. The goal is to address how trucks will handle weigh station inspections without a driver present to facilitate the process.
Earnings
Online used car retailer Carvana reported higher-than-expected earnings of $2.96 billion in Q2, with adjusted EBITDA totaling $155 million. The company sold 76,530 cars during the quarter, which was slightly fewer than expected by analysts.
Carvana also announced it will reduce its outstanding debt by over $1.2 billion by exchanging existing unsecured debt with new notes. The company might also sell up to $350 million in new stock as part of the restructure.
The combined news of healthy earnings and debt exchange deal caused Carvana’s stock to spike Wednesday as high as $60.90. The company’s stock has come back down to earth somewhat, settling at around $47 Thursday at market close.
Tesla hit $25 billion in revenue in the second quarter, which just beat Wall Street estimates. Despite the record revenue, Tesla’s stock started to slide in after-hours and the next day by as much as 10%. That was likely a response to Tesla’s continued hit to automotive gross margins after a series of price cuts. Margins slid to around 18%, which is down from the 25% Tesla was rocking a year ago.
Tesla also reported that solar installations are slipping, but energy storage installations saw a boost in the second quarter.
Electric vehicles
Ford has slashed the price of its F-150 Lightning, in some trims by as much as $10,000. The automaker cited manufacturing efficiencies as the cause of the lower price.
Ford is also being questioned by House Republicans over its battery cell technology deal with China’s CATL in its upcoming $3.5 billion battery cell plant in Michigan.
General Motors is experiencing downtime at its CAMI plant in Canada (which builds the BrightDrop commercial EVs) in order to manage parts-availability issues. Regular operations will resume July 31, and it won’t affect GM’s overall EV production targets in North America — 50,000 in the first half and 100,000 in the second.
Remember the Kia Boys? The people who had been following a viral trend on TikTok to steal Kias using a USB cord? A 14-year-old Texas boy has been linked to nearly 40 thefts.
The NHTSA has opened up its third special investigation into a Tesla crash this year. This is related to a fatal crash involving a 2018 Model 3 and connected to the vehicle’s Autopilot system.
Nissan has joined the ranks of automakers that have adopted Tesla’s NACS charging standard for its Ariya and future EV models.
Rivian can move ahead with its EV facility production plans in Georgia after the state’s Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the validity of about $700 million in tax breaks the EV startup expects to receive.
Stellantis has signed $11.2 billion worth of contracts through 2030 to secure semiconductors needed for its EVs and high-performance computing functions.
India’s Tata Motors plans to build a 40 GWh battery cell gigafactory in the United Kingdom. The over $5.16 billion investment will deliver batteries for JLR and Tata Motors, with supplies beginning in 2026.
Vietnam’s VinFast will hold a groundbreaking ceremony at its electric vehicle factory in North Carolina on July 28. The company expects to invest $4 billion in the factory, which is designed to reach a capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year.
Volkswagen’s Knoxville Innovation Hub has published research breakthroughs to increase EV range and recycle vehicle materials, the company said. These include a wireless EV charging concept.
TeslaCrunch
It was another big week of Tesla news, especially with the automaker kicking off earnings season. Let’s dive in.
During Tesla’s Q2 earnings call, Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla was in talks with a major OEM to license its FSD software and hardware out to them. FSD (“full self-driving”) is Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system that is NOT fully autonomous, despite the tech’s confusing name. Musk also said that for Q3 only, Tesla owners looking to upgrade to newer models could transfer their FSD over.
Earlier in the week, Tesla announced that drivers with home solar and a Powerwall charger now have an in-app option to exclusively charge up their vehicle via excess solar energy.
The automaker also showed off its first Cybertruck built at Giga Texas over the weekend, to much fanfare but few specifics. We’re still wondering about production capacity and price, which were not addressed during the earnings call.
Outside the U.S., Tesla is hoping to expand its German factory, but residents want assurances on water use, biodiversity protection and environmental impact.
Also, Tesla directors, including Musk, will have to pay $735 million back to the company to settle claims from shareholders that they excessively overpaid themselves. As part of the deal, the directors also agreed not to receive compensation for 2021, 2022 and 2023.
Miscellaneous
ByteDance’s Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) is doing food delivery now? So food delivery giant Meituan decided to add more video to its app in kind.
Policymakers have introduced a bill that would increase fuel taxes for private jet travel from the current $0.22 to $1.95 per gallon, and remove existing fuel tax exemptions for logging and oil or gas exploration. The idea is that if the rich want to pollute our skies, they can pay extra. The revenue generated by the so-called FATCAT Act would be transferred to a fund that would support air monitoring for environmental justice communities.
Spotify is bringing a new experience to Teslas that will make displaying content bolder and more accessible. Drivers can take advantage of features like QR codes for easy log-in, access to audiobooks, and one-touch jump to artists and album pages.
Uber Freight has laid off almost 50 brokerage employees.
People
EVTOL startup Archer has brought on Nikhil Goel, co-founder of Uber Elevate, as the company’s chief commercial officer. This comes on the heels of adding former FAA administrator Billy Nolen.
Ride-hail
InDrive has launched its bid-based ride-hail app in Miami, its first U.S. market. The company’s business model is based on customers naming their own fare and nearby drivers accepting, declining or countering the offer.
Revel, the Brooklyn-based startup doing shared e-mopeds, EV charging hubs and an all-electric, all-employee ride-hail service, announced that it has hired over 1,000 New Yorkers as Q2 employee drivers.
The California Supreme Court rejected an argument by Uber that hoped to limit the ability of its drivers to take employment-related disputes to court. The court unanimously determined that the defendant, driver Erik Adolph, couldn’t sign away his right to represent his peers in a class-action lawsuit, even though his contract requires him to take any employment-related disputes to arbitration. This ruling could have ripple effects in the gig economy space.

25,Can Europe’s cannabis market avoid the US’ mistakes? Investors chime in,https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/23/europe-cannabis-market-2023/,"Sun, 23 Jul 2023 17:00:32 +0000","As Europe grapples with cannabis legalization, what can it learn from the US' journey? ","When it comes to Europe’s cannabis market, the biggest piece of news this year is what didn’t happen. Contrary to what a lot of people expected, Germany isn’t on the way to legalizing recreational use of marijuana. Instead, the EU’s most populated country watered down its law reform plans after liaising with regulators.
Is Germany’s decision and the precedent it has set bad news for VCs who invest in cannabis startups in Europe? Not necessarily, and it could even be good news for some. According to Oliver Lamb, co-founder of Óskare Capital, Germany’s “push to slow down the legalization of recreational cannabis is positive for the medical and pharmaceutical market.”
“The hybrid recreational-medical experiment has already been played out in North America, and there were a painful amount of lessons learned that it would be reckless to ignore,” he said.
Lamb, like other investors, is wary of the mistakes they’ve seen being made in the U.S.: “The blurred line between the medical and recreational sectors has undoubtedly been to the detriment of targeted medication development,” he said.
“It is crucial to use lessons from paths that others have laid before you. In New York, we’ve seen a failure to do this, with just a handful of dispensaries up and running alongside lax law enforcement, which led to an overt and booming illicit market,” said Matt Hawkins, founder and managing partner at Entourage Effect Capital.
However, some funds are worried that the total addressable market for legal cannabis on the continent is limited and has been affected by Germany's decision. “The scaling back by Germany has made us more hesitant to deploy capital in Europe,” Hawkins said. “Germany’s process has indicated the entire continent will struggle to create a commercial adult-use market in the coming years and have a limited TAM.”
Similarly, like other private businesses looking to raise venture capital, cannabis startups aren’t immune to the global repricing that investors are pushing for. “European cannabis companies are still overvalued,” said Emily Paxhia, co-founder and managing partner at Poseidon Investment Management.
For founders of cannabis-related startups hoping to weather the slowdown, the advice isn’t very different from what all entrepreneurs are being told at the moment: survive and advance. That’s Poseidon’s motto, Paxhia said.
For cannabis companies that know they won’t survive, finding a buyer seems to be a viable option, as consolidation is expected in the coming months. But whether we are talking about investments or M&A, we are in a strong buyer’s market, Lamb warned.
Read on to find out where these investors see the next opportunity, how they plan to tackle the market following Germany’s decision, and how to best pitch them.

Is cannabis more legally accessible in Europe this year than it was when we conducted our previous survey last year? Have there been any key regulatory changes at play?
On the medical side, cannabinoid therapeutics and non-cannabinoid therapeutics (i.e., therapeutics that modulate the endocannabinoid system but do so without cannabinoids) are notably increasing in availability.
There are many factors at play that explain this shift, amongst them [being] increases in tailwinds and reductions in headwinds. Today we have more, higher quality clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of these medications for various conditions, coupled with an uptick in highly qualified teams that are bringing these medications to market.
As for the tailwinds, difficulties in patient access have long hindered prescriptions of medications that target the endocannabinoid system (the mammalian regulatory system that reacts to cannabinoids and cannabinoid-like molecules, similar to the central nervous system).
However, we are excited to see a number of technologies and platforms linking specialized doctors with patients in need of these medications. One such example is Leva, whose digital clinic is tackling the vastly underserved chronic pain market in the U.K.
Alongside this, there is a growing acceptance within medical communities of the suitability of ECS-modulating medications for certain pathologies. At a conference in Berlin this month, a founder happily relayed that a recent meeting of general practitioners dedicated two hours to talk about medical cannabinoids. This is a clear indicator of the increasing understanding and adoption of these medications by doctors across Europe.
Aside from watered-down plans to legalize recreational use, Germany imported a record amount of marijuana for medical and scientific use in 2022. Is this taking focus away from the fact that imports are slowing?
Although Germany’s decision was undoubtedly unpopular at companies that bet on the legislation going in the opposite direction, this push to slow down the legalization of recreational cannabis is positive for the medical and pharmaceutical market.
The hybrid recreational-medical experiment has already been played out in North America, and there were a painful amount of lessons learned that it would be reckless to ignore. Specifically, legalizing recreational cannabis in tandem with medical use in North America can be seen to have diminished the incentives for researchers to develop targeted therapeutics for specific pathologies, given the flood of cannabis flower being distributed through dispensaries. That happened despite a preference held by the majority of doctors to prescribe targeted and licensed treatment that does not need to be smoked.
The North American approach also blurred the lines between the recreational and medical markets, strengthening the impression that users of such therapeutics were simply prioritizing pleasure while claiming a genuine need.
This misconception is not only counterproductive for patients looking for proven treatments, [but] it also detracts attention from the fact that ECS-modulating medications can provide not only far superior side-effect profiles compared to traditional pharmaceuticals such as opiates, but also treatments for conditions that are currently untreatable.
The Czech Republic might end up legalizing recreational cannabis use before Germany, but it is a smaller market. Is it big enough to move the needle and find out what the EU will tolerate?
Peter Lynch once noted that if you spend 13 minutes a year on economics, you’ve wasted 10 minutes. Politics is arguably the same. Influences on international regulation are vast and varied, and even if you have a good idea of the outcome, the timings are just as complicated to predict.
Therefore, as a rule, we don’t bet on regulation. Instead, we invest in what we know: strong teams, innovative science and untapped market opportunities. We select our investments assuming that the regulatory landscape is fixed as it is today. That way, if nothing changes, we know that they can succeed regardless, and as and when things continue to open up, they can be positioned to benefit further.
A prediction I do feel confident in making is that governments and medical communities will continue to gain understanding of the benefits of these medications.
How has your approach to investing in the cannabis sector changed in the last 12 months? What are your expectations for the next 12 months? Is consolidation in the cards in that period?
With regards to our thesis, not at all. We started by focusing on Europe and continue to do so. Likewise, we launched the fund to target life sciences and deep tech investments in the sector, and this remains unchanged, largely due to the fact that our portfolio is performing very well.
It’s also gratifying to see that a number of U.S. funds are now looking to Europe for the next wave of growth in the sector. This is an asset, as we like to syndicate rounds and having stakeholders across the pond is often helpful when it comes to intercontinental expansion.
Here are our predictions for this year, and those we made for 2022 are here.
We’re happy to say that most of our past predictions have come to fruition, and those for this year are on track to do the same.
What advice are you giving your cannabis-related portfolio companies right now in terms of preserving or extending their runway?",,

Musk tweeted late Saturday night that he'd replace the Twitter bird logo with an ‘X' logo as soon as Sunday or Monday “worldwide,” provided he got a good-looking enough one submitted in time. Musk then tweeted on Sunday a short teaser animation of an X graphic on a black background that presumably means he got his wish.

— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023

The Twitter blue bird logo and brand name are not long for this world, according to a separate post by Musk on his social network. Twitter's ‘CEO' Linda Yaccarino so far hasn't chimed in on the change on her own account, despite ostensibly leading the company Musk overpaid for late last year. Twitter couldn't be reached for comment because like a child Elon has replaced the media contact email with a bot that auto responds on a frustrating and endless loop.
Also like a child, Musk seems intent on naming everything ‘X' just because he likes it and is fixated on it (there's an x in fixated hope you liked that one Elon); he's named his new AI company ‘x.AI' and literally will not shut up about how badly he wanted X to be the name for PayPal when his original company with that name merged with another to make the online payments giant.
As of this writing, Twitter is still Twitter and the blue bird still flies, but that could change at any moment, as with everything this fickle billionaire touches these days.

27,Gear Patrol’s acquisition of DPReview shows that it can pay to be boring,https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/23/slow-is-smooth-and-smooth-is-fast/,"Sun, 23 Jul 2023 15:00:17 +0000","DPReview and Gear Patrol are different boats, rowing in the same direction toward better products and product knowledge for enthusiasts.","In March, DPReview announced that parent company Amazon was shutting it down, and the photography world entered a dual state of shock and disbelief.
For 25 years, DPReview had served as a consistently reliable and authoritative voice on photography gear. But photography enthusiasts didn’t just go to DPReview to drool over Canon’s newest lens or compare Sony and Nikon’s face-detection autofocusing capabilities. It was an active forum where we (yes, I’m one of those photography people) could hang out and geek out.
That such an extensive archive of photography knowledge and the strong community it had fostered was being banished to the abyss — the plan wasn’t even to archive it but to switch it off completely — was a blow to many. The announcement on DPReview garnered over 5,000 comments, and people took to social media to share their thoughts about Amazon’s decision.

Startups, be careful who you sell to

 
But that soon changed when Gear Patrol — which offers advice, how-tos and product reviews, but not specific to cameras — came to the rescue. It finalized a deal to purchase DPReview from Amazon for an undisclosed sum in June 2023. I was excited to speak to Eric Yang, Gear Patrol’s founder and CEO, to find out what motivated the purchase and what he learned from the process.
Authority and community
Yang was driven to bring DPReview under the Gear Patrol aegis for several reasons, and while it made business sense, there was a personal motivation there, too.
“It's a business, so it's not a totally altruistic endeavor,” Yang told me. “But DPReview is very meaningful to me. It's meaningful to a lot of people, I think, who have grown up on the internet.”
DPReview is home to an extraordinary knowledge base that Yang was reluctant to see disappear. But this knowledge base doesn’t reside just in its vast archive of reviews, buying guides, editorials and advice; it’s also in the strong community that this expertise fostered. For so many people, DPReview was a safe place to express opinions, ask for advice, or just be photography geeks. All of this, together, was valuable to Yang.
A natural fit
Yang describes Gear Patrol as a place that empowers people to pursue their interests and passions with confidence, which is why he believes that Gear Patrol and DPReview are a natural fit. “We want to help people have the knowledge that they need to pursue their particular passions in the best possible way,” Yang said.",,

It was an event-filled week in the fintech world, what with FedNow launching, the former CEO of fintech Bolt — and the company itself — being subpoenaed by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission and much more. Let's drill down here.
It's about time
Last week, the U.S. government’s instant payment system, FedNow Service, finally went live.
FedNow is an instant payment infrastructure for transferring money that promises to be a faster payment rail for financial institutions, offering immediate access to funds no matter the day or time. As you know, this is huge because banks aren’t traditionally open 24/7 or let you receive money and use it on the same day.
It’s also something that the U.S. has been considered “behind” on in light even though other countries have been live with similar services for some time, including Brazil, India, the United Kingdom and the European Union. In fact, anecdotally, we hear that in Brazil, the country’s similar system, Pix, is so commonplace that people are even using it over credit cards to pay street vendors. And there's data to back that up, too.
We did a deep dive on what the long-awaited launch of the service might mean for the U.S. on Friday. But one thing we didn’t touch on: how banks choose to price FedNow to their customers and how that might impact how quickly it is adopted.
Via email, Adam Shapiro, a partner at financial services advisory and investment firm Klaros Group, noted that the Fed charges banks around 4 cents for a FedNow payment, compared to less than half a cent for an ACH payment. However, he added, banks are free to charge customers what they like for these payments. As such, according to Shapiro, “business customers that are deciding which to use may be deterred if banks make FedNow significantly more expensive than ACH.”
He added: “A business may be prepared to pay 3.5 cents to get someone money faster, but draw the line at paying 25 cents. Also, how fraud is handled and where liability falls should something go wrong will shape adoption.”
Weekly News
Christine reported on the fact that a letter authored in April by a lawyer representing Bolt investors said the SEC was investigating whether federal securities laws were violated in connection with statements made when Bolt was raising money in 2021. The letter was sent to Bolt’s general counsel as part of a fact-finding mission. Per a letter referenced by The Information, Brian Reinken of WestCap Management and Arjun Sethi of Tribe Capital Management, investors in Bolt's Series C and Series B rounds, respectively, demanded to look at the company's records, claiming that ex-CEO Ryan Breslow allegedly “misled” investors while fundraising for the company’s $355 million Series E round. You may recall that Breslow had stepped down from his role as CEO in January of 2022.
Mary Ann teamed up with Rebecca Szkutak to look at just how far fintech valuations have fallen since the heydays of the venture boom (see graph below). Unsurprisingly, valuations for most of the highest valued fintech companies are down, with three notable exceptions — all of whom operate in the same space. They looked at valuations based on secondary share activity (as analyzed by Notice.co), which some argue may be a more accurate reflection of what a company is worth than public valuations at the time of a fundraise. They also talked to a few industry experts to get a sense of what’s ahead. Check it out here:  Fintech valuations have fallen. Where do they go from here? (TC+)
TC’s Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim did a deep dive into the world of insurtech for TechCrunch+, noting that while some industries were able to get over the hump of inflated valuations from 2021, this industry didn’t seem to be one of them. So much so that one report called it the “death of insurtech 1.0.” Alex and Anna look at how global startups fared, and if there are signs that this industry can indeed recover. (TC+)
Reporter Dominic-Madori Davis wrote about the aftermath of an acquisition involving neobank Greenwood, which caters to Black and Latino customers, and The Gathering Spot, a networking club with similar interests. As you will see, everything was going well…until it didn’t. Now there are sour feelings and a lawsuit. Though none of the parties commented, Dominic-Madori details what went wrong. The debate of whether niche-focused neobanks will ultimately prove successful continues as Daylight, another neobank focused on the LGBTQ+ community, recently shut down.
Get your palm ready! Reporter Sarah Perez covered Amazon’s palm-scanning payment technology coming to all 500 Amazon-owned Whole Foods stores by the end of the year. Here’s how it works: Utilizing a biometric payment system, the customers hover their palm above a reader device that identifies the individual’s unique palm signature and associates it with the customer’s payment card on file in order to charge them for their purchases. Don’t worry, your palm data is not shared.
Medical procedures often involve a complicated web of bills and payments that can stretch for months or even years later. I (Christine) personally had a collections agency chase after me for a $50 urine test (I was 21 years old and didn’t know better), so I can imagine what it’s like for someone owing thousands of dollars in medical fees. This week I wrote about Collectly, a company that developed proprietary interfaces that integrate with electronic health records and practice management software to make patient billing operations easier.  By making it easier to pay, the company touts that medical company customers were, on average, able to increase patient collections for medical group partners by 75%, reducing the “days sales outstanding” to 12 days from between 60 and 90 days. Though Collectly’s customers are the medical offices, I’d like to think that the digitizing of medical bills is something that can help patients, too. Who wouldn’t want a one-click way to access and pay all the bills associated with a procedure?
CB Insights released its Q2 State of Fintech Report last week, and unsurprisingly, global funding in the space was down — plunging by nearly half to $7.8 billion, its lowest level since 2017. But at least one region didn’t have a bad quarter. Can you guess which one it was? Meanwhile, payments — which has historically been the darling of the fintech space — didn’t have a great three months. Read more here.
Visa and Mastercard were hit with an antitrust suit by fintech company Block. In a suit filed July 14 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Block alleges the two credit card giants “conspired to vastly overcharge the Square payment platform, causing higher retail prices paid by consumers,” by inflating interchange fees as a way to maintain market share, according to a Bloomberg report.
Tech giant Apple in late March finally launched its Apple Pay Later service, which allows users to split the cost of an Apple Pay purchase into four equal payments over six weeks without interest or late fees. The move put Apple in direct competition with the likes of Affirm, PayPal and Klarna. How’s it going so far? Well, according to J.D. Power, pretty darn good. A recent report found that about a fifth of BNPL (buy now, pay later) customers said they used Apple Pay Later in its first three months. Additionally, the report also revealed that Apple has “a potentially more stable, sustainable user base than competitors do. And beyond that, data suggest it may be attracting first time BNPL users that might not otherwise consider BNPL as an option.” This all led J.D. Power to conclude: “There are no guarantees, but Apple Pay Later has got a lot going for it — [this] is a nice thing to have in general, and especially when Apple itself is diving further into financial services.”

Poor timing for AI-generated TV: AI startup Fable Studios demoed its platform this week, using it to create a full, fake “South Park” episode in which Cartman tries to apply deepfake technology to the media industry. The tech was impressive, Devin writes, but — juxtaposed against the ongoing strike of creatives in TV and film — the stunt came across as a tad inartful.
Not a good look for Microsoft security: Microsoft still doesn’t know — or want to share — how China-backed hackers stole a key that allowed them to stealthily break into dozens of email inboxes, including those belonging to several government agencies. The company first disclosed the incident last Tuesday, attributing the monthlong activity to a newly discovered espionage group it's calling Storm-0558, which it believes has a strong nexus to China.
The other Threads surges to new heights: Instagram’s Twitter clone Threads enjoyed a fairly fruitful first week in existence, sailing past 30 million users in the first 24 hours. But it's had the unintended effect of thrusting Threads, an unrelated app first pitched as a Slack alternative, into the spotlight. Threads (the Slack alternative) reportedly racked up more than 880,000 downloads on iOS between July 6 and July 12, after Meta's Threads launched, having had few downloads prior to this point.
Telsa unveils the first Cybertruck build: Tesla over the weekend said its first, much-anticipated Cybertruck came off the production line in Texas. The debut of the long-delayed, futuristic-looking pickup truck comes in the lead-up to Tesla’s second-quarter 2023 earnings call.
OnlyFans CEO steps down: After about two and a half years at the helm, Ami Gan is leaving OnlyFans. Chief strategy and operations officer Keily Blair will take over as CEO. As Amanda writes, OnlyFans is perhaps the best-known creator platform that supports adult content; according to Gan, the company paid out $10 billion to creators while she was CEO.
New sites, generated by AI: Wix, a longtime fixture of the web-building space, is betting that today’s customers don’t particularly care to spend time customizing every aspect of their site’s appearance. The company’s new AI Site Generator tool, announced this week, will allow Wix users to describe their intent and generate a website complete with a homepage, inner pages and text and images — as well as business-specific sections for events, bookings and more.
Plex makes its Winamp-inspired player free: Plexamp, the music player originally incubated by the Labs division of media company Plex, is now free. The project was first launched in 2017 as a subscription-based spin on the classic Winamp media player app, offering visualizations to accompany your tunes, tools for programming mixes, and more recently, a ChatGPT-powered “Sonic Sage” feature that builds unique playlists from users’ music libraries.
VanMoof e-bikes, saved: Since struggling e-bike startup VanMoof confirmed it has asked for a deferment of payment in Holland, there's been a question hanging over the VanMoof bikes out there in the wild. Riding to the rescue, somewhat improbably, is Cowboy, VanMoof's e-bike competitor over the border in Belgium. Cowboy's “Bikey” app enables VanMoof riders to generate their unique digital key and keep riding, Mike writes.

On Equity, PitchBook venture guru Kyle Stanford came to riff with the crew on the venture capital in Q2 2023: the good, the bad, and the late stage.
The latest episode of Found, meanwhile, spotlighted Catherine Tabor, the founder and CEO of Sparkfly, a company that helps brands with marketing and customer engagement. Tabor talked about building a company fluid enough to adapt to changing technology trends over the last decade and how she was dismissed by venture capitalists despite landing notable customers.

Electric utilities drive customers to startups: Of all the companies that should be eager to embrace the electric transition, electric utilities would seem to be at the top of the list. Yet they also appear to be some of the most hesitant. Startups are taking advantage of the situation, Tim writes.
Mixed-gender founding teams raise over a billion dollars: U.S. startups with mixed-gender founding teams — meaning they have at least one female founder — raised $24.1 billion in the first half of 2023, which breaks down to $17.2 billion in Q1 and $6.9 billion in Q2, per the latest PitchBook data. That's a big deal — but it's important to note that startups with all-women founding teams are still struggling to raise money this year.
Ripple's XRP case and the lack of regulatory clarity: Last week, the crypto community celebrated a U.S. federal court case that ruled Ripple’s XRP token does not make up illegal securities sales — but only in some cases. Though many celebrated the ruling, it’s not a true win for crypto — Jacquelyn explains why.

Today I'm looking at a recent acquisition that shows the drive toward more resilient APIs. Also this week, a recent round that adds nuance to the market for substance abuse therapy startups. — Anna
Resilient APIs
Creating and distributing APIs might soon be easier: Speakeasy, an early-stage startup, is working on it.
“We’ve started by working on an important problem to me, one that I’ve faced a lot myself as a developer, which is really dramatically simplifying how developers are able to ship APIs to end users,” its CEO Sagar Batchu told TechCrunch's Ron Miller.

Speakeasy is using AI to automate API creation and distribution

However, large companies with over 5,000 developers already struggle with API sprawl, according to a survey supporting API platform Postman’s 2023 State of the API Report. Thirty-one percent of respondents at these large companies mentioned “managing too many APIs or microservices” as an obstacle to producing APIs, compared with just 23% of all survey-takers.
It's not hard to see how this finding connects to Postman's recently announced acquisition and upcoming integration of API observability startup ​​Akita Software. “Akita’s addition will make it easier than ever for users to manage their production APIs, even in the face of API sprawl,” its press release states.
According to Akita founder Jean Yang, the rise of APIs has fundamentally changed the software development process. “More and more testing has moved to production. Intended behavior is now based on observed behavior. More and more, the only way for teams to figure out even what's running is by inspecting production. We need new tools that meet developers where they are: not just for building the first draft of software, but for debugging, maintenance, and the nth draft,” she wrote in her announcement.
On a related note, chaos engineering might no longer be the sole domain of site reliability engineers.

31,Deal Dive: Futureverse is a metaverse company that might actually get it,https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/22/futureverse-metaverse-fundraise/,"Sat, 22 Jul 2023 16:00:12 +0000","Futureverse is making tools that brands can use to build content for the metaverse, but not the one that Meta is envisioning.","Startups that look to improve an industry's outdated infrastructure are definitely welcome in sectors like financial services and healthcare. But why would a company build infrastructure for an industry that seems to have hit its prime and zoomed past it in record time?
That was my question when I saw the news about Futureverse's recent $54 million Series A round. The startup is a platform of 11 companies that range from gaming studios and entities that enable web3 payments, to blockchain startups providing the tools for brands and builders to more easily create content for the metaverse.
I'm missing something. Aren't we all tired of hearing about the metaverse against our will? Haven't we come to the realization that folks don't want their social or work lives to look anything like Second Life?
Aaron McDonald, co-founder and CEO of Futureverse, told TechCrunch+ that some of the more vocal players in the category have made the metaverse seem like it's one thing — a virtual world — as opposed to what he sees it as: technology that could create a virtual world and also power a lot of other things.
For McDonald, it's not dissimilar to how we think about the internet today compared to when the term was first coined — it's no longer a thing, but rather the thing that powers applications and websites. In line with that frame of thinking, Futureverse defines the metaverse as the collection of interoperable applications built on top of user data.
Essentially, the Futureverse is looking to help people build more encompassing experiences where the users don't realize it's run on the blockchain or utilizes NFTs, McDonald said.
One example of this is a game Futureverse launched with FIFA for the Women's World Cup. Users coach a team of automated players in an immersive world, but they aren't made aware of the fact that it is run on web3 and utilizes NFTs. To most users, then, it is just a game.",,

Cooking robot company Botinkit raises $13M
Chain restaurants value consistency and efficiency, two things that lend themselves well to automation. Shenzhen-based startup Botinkit has brought its cooking robots beyond China’s borders to Japan and the U.S., and now will use the $13 million it raised in a Series A to bring its culinary creators to Europe and the Middle East.
Beyond cutting back on the loss of ingredients and energy usage during the cooking process, Botinkit sees another benefit to its robots.
“Cuisine used to be restricted by time and geographical boundaries. However, with the digitization of cooking, a range of new possibilities arise, including remote cooking. Suppose I’m in Shenzhen and you’re in the U.S., I can use our software and hardware system to ‘cook’ for you remotely,” co-founder Shirley Chen told TechCrunch earlier this week.
SoftBank invests in Rice Robotics’ deliveries
Workers in SoftBank’s new Tokyo headquarters have been using delivery robots with wide, adorable eyes to ferry 7-Eleven orders between the stores and drop-off locations. The cartoonish couriers, made by Hong Kong-based Rice Robotics, can run for 12 hours and just take an hour to recharge between onigiri and UCC coffee runs.
And SoftBank announced this week it would be contributing toward Rice’s $7 million pre-Series A funding round, which will be put toward a continued expansion within Japan, the company’s No. 1 source of revenue.
ForwardX’s robotics efforts hit $140M in fundraising
Warehouse logistics and inventory management have been discussed in past editions, and for good reason — it’s a huge industry ripe with opportunity for robotics and automation. And ForwardX, based in Beijing, has been collecting a significant amount of investment since launching in 2016.
The company, which has already dispatched 3,000 robots across a client list that includes IKEA, UNIQLO, Walmart and Mitsubishi, just announced a $30 million fundraise that brings its Series C to $61 million and its total funding to $140 million.
Women in Robotics launches a scholarship in honor of Joanne Pransky
Joanne Pransky, who recently passed away following decades of work within the robotics industry, left an indelible mark on the space as she sought to spur an understanding of the human side of our relationships with robots.
The nonprofit Women in Robotics is looking to honor her legacy by helping the next wave of women and non-binary students with a scholarship that takes her namesake. Anyone can help contribute to the fund right here via Bold.org.
“As a pioneer in the field of social robotics and the sales and marketing of robots and robotics journals, Joanne was very often the only woman in the room,” Women in Robotics president Andra Keay told TechCrunch. And with the help of the Joanne Pransky Celebration of Women in Robotics scholarship, that will be a thing of the past.

So until an AI can do it for you, here’s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn’t cover on their own.
This week in AI, we saw OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon voluntarily commit to pursuing shared AI safety and transparency goals ahead of a planned Executive Order from the Biden administration.
As my colleague Devin Coldewey writes, there's no rule or enforcement being proposed, here — the practices agreed to are purely voluntary. But the pledges indicate, in broad strokes, the AI regulatory approaches and policies that each vendor might find amendable in the U.S. as well as abroad.
Among other commitments, the companies volunteered to conduct security tests of AI systems before release, share information on AI mitigation techniques and develop watermarking techniques that make AI-generated content easier to identify. They also said that they would invest in cybersecurity to protect private AI data and facilitate the reporting of vulnerabilities, as well as prioritize research on societal risks like systemic bias and privacy issues.
The commitments are important step, to be sure — even if they're not enforceable. But one wonders if there are ulterior motives on the part of the undersigners.

Top AI companies visit the White House to make ‘voluntary' safety commitments

Reportedly, OpenAI drafted an internal policy memo that shows the company supports the idea of requiring government licenses from anyone who wants to develop AI systems. CEO Sam Altman first raised the idea at a U.S. Senate hearing in May, during which he backed the creation of an agency that could issue licenses for AI products — and revoke them should anyone violate set rules.
In a recent interview with press, Anna Makanju, OpenAI's VP of global affairs, insisted that OpenAI wasn't “pushing” for licenses and that the company only supports licensing regimes for AI models more powerful than OpenAI's current GPT-4. But government-issued licenses, should they be implemented in the way that OpenAI proposes, set the stage for a potential clash with startups and open source developers who may see them as an attempt to make it more difficult for others to break into the space.
Devin said it best, I think, when he described it to me as “dropping nails on the road behind them in a race.” At the very least, it illustrates the two-faced nature of AI companies who seek to placate regulators while shaping policy to their favor (in this case putting small challengers at a disadvantage) behind the scenes.
It's a worrisome state of affairs. But, if policymakers step up to the plate, there's hope yet for sufficient safeguards without undue interference from the private sector.
Here are other AI stories of note from the past few days:

OpenAI's trust and safety head steps down: Dave Willner, an industry veteran who was OpenAI's head of trust and safety, announced in a post on LinkedIn that he's left the job and transitioned to an advisory role. OpenAI said in a statement that it’s seeking a replacement and that CTO Mira Murati will manage the team on an interim basis.
Customized instructions for ChatGPT: In more OpenAI news, the company has launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users so that they don’t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.
Google news-writing AI: Google is testing a tool that uses AI to write news stories and has started demoing it to publications, according to a new report from The New York Times. The tech giant has pitched the AI system to The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal’s owner, News Corp.
Apple tests a ChatGPT-like chatbot: Apple is developing AI to challenge OpenAI, Google and others, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Specifically, the tech giant has created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as “Apple GPT.”
Meta releases Llama 2: Meta unveiled a new family of AI models, Llama 2, designed to drive apps along the lines of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Bing Chat and other modern chatbots. Trained on a mix of publicly available data, Meta claims that Llama 2’s performance has improved significantly over the previous generation of Llama models.
Authors protest against generative AI: Generative AI systems like ChatGPT are trained on publicly available data, including books — and not all content creators are pleased with the arrangement. In an open letter signed by more than 8,500 authors of fiction, non-fiction and poetry, the tech companies behind large language models like ChatGPT, Bard, LLaMa and more are taken to task for using their writing without permission or compensation.
Microsoft brings Bing Chat to the enterprise: At its annual Inspire conference, Microsoft announced Bing Chat Enterprise, a version of its Bing Chat AI-powered chatbot with business-focused data privacy and governance controls. With Bing Chat Enterprise, chat data isn’t saved, Microsoft can’t view a customer’s employee or business data and customer data isn’t used to train the underlying AI models.

More machine learnings
Technically this was also a news item, but it bears mentioning here in the research section. Fable Studios, which previously made CG and 3D short films for VR and other media, showed off an AI model it calls Showrunner that (it claims) can write, direct, act in and edit an entire TV show — in their demo, it was South Park.

Maybe showing off an AI-generated fake TV episode during a writers' strike is a bad idea

I'm of two minds on this. On one hand, I think pursuing this at all, let alone during a huge Hollywood strike that involves issues of compensation and AI, is in rather poor taste. Though CEO Edward Saatchi said he believes that the tool puts power in the hands of creators, the opposite is also arguable. At any rate it was not received particularly well by people in the industry.
On the other hand, if someone on the creative side (which Saatchi is) does not explore and demonstrate these capabilities, then they will be explored and demonstrated by others with less compunction about putting them to use. Even if the claims Fable makes are a bit expansive for what they actually showed (which has serious limitations) it is like the original DALL-E in that it prompted discussion and indeed worry even though it was no replacement for a real artist. AI is going to have a place in media production one way or the other — but for a whole sack of reasons it should be approached with caution.
On the policy side, a little while back we had the National Defense Authorization Act going through with (as usual) some really ridiculous policy amendments that have nothing to do with defense. But among them was one addition that the government must host an event where researchers are companies can do their best to detect AI-generated content. This kind of thing is definitely approaching “national crisis” levels so it's probably good this got slipped in there.

Over at Disney Research, they're always trying to find a way to bridge the digital and the real — for park purposes, presumably. In this case they have developed a way to map virtual movements of a character or motion capture (say for a CG dog in a film) onto an actual robot, even if that robot is a different shape or size. It relies on two optimization systems each informing the other of what is ideal and what is possible, sort of like a little ego and super-ego. This should make it much easier to make robot dogs act like regular dogs, but of course it's generalizable to other stuff as well.
And here's hoping AI can help us steer the world away from sea-bottom mining for minerals, because that is definitely a bad idea. A multi-institutional study put AI's ability to sift signal from noise to work predicting the location of valuable minerals around the globe. As they write in the abstract:
In this work, we embrace the complexity and inherent “messiness” of our planet’s intertwined geological, chemical, and biological systems by employing machine learning to characterize patterns embedded in the multidimensionality of mineral occurrence and associations.
The study actually predicted and verified locations of uranium, lithium, and other valuable minerals. And how about this for a closing line: the system “will enhance our understanding of mineralization and mineralizing environments on Earth, across our solar system, and through deep time.” Awesome.

Israel is a country that has battled for its existence and survival since Day 1.
Having fought multiple wars and living with ongoing threats, Israelis are now in a fierce battle for their democracy. This battle is not fought with tanks or guns but with the power of unity, protest, and the determination to protect the very essence of their nation.
Last week, hundreds of thousands poured onto the streets across the country in response to the Netanyahu government’s passage, and in a first Knesset reading, of the “reasonableness bill,” which will severely restrict judicial review of decisions made by the cabinet, government ministers, and other elected officials.
The bill is part of a contentious legislative package advanced by the hardline Netanyahu coalition that aims to radically overhaul Israel’s independent judiciary and curb checks and balances on political power. This week, the government plans to bring the bill for its final votes.
And our unequivocal answer is, “NO.”
We at JVP and the entire Israeli high-tech sector, whose members went out in droves to protest, alongside doctors, teachers, members of the military reserves, pilots, special forces units, and people from all walks of life, are saying no to dictatorship and yes to democracy.
	
		
			Often, in the history of countries, there are key moments of real, existential crisis that demand answers on values.					
	
	
In addition to their contributions to Israel's economy, the tech community recognizes the vital role that democracy and societal openness play in fostering innovation, invention, and creativity. These values are the very foundation of the national spirit that drives the country's success on the global stage. As a result, the high-tech sector has joined forces with other industries to stand united in the defense of democratic principles that have allowed Israel to flourish.
We refuse to let our hard-fought freedoms be undermined by a government seeking to consolidate power and erode the principles that have made Israel a beacon of democracy in the region.
What Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has found in many of us are warriors. Just like we have been warriors on the front lines, we are also warriors in this battle for democracy. We understand that the strength of a nation lies not only in its military might but also in its commitment to upholding the values of justice, equality, and freedom. We will not stand idly by as these values are threatened.
With last week’s mass demonstrations and more protests planned this week, Israelis from the center, the left, and the moderate right convey a powerful message to Netanyahu and his far-right partners: The judicial overhaul he and they are trying to lead is unacceptable and will not be allowed to pass. We refuse to let Israel slide down the dangerous path of illiberal governance witnessed in countries like Poland and Hungary. Our country's strength lies in its vibrant democracy, where the rule of law prevails and every citizen's rights are protected.
In a country with such strong societal bonds and with so many people who have sacrificed and paid heavy prices, we can’t let this government hijack the judicial system and transform Israel from a proud, hard-earned liberal democracy into something we no longer recognize.
For Israelis, democracy and societal openness are the very fundamental conditions of innovation, invention, and creativity. It is our national spirit.
The collective determination to defend democratic principles reflects the deep societal bonds and the belief that preserving democracy is vital for the continued success and prosperity of the nation.
Technology and innovation — for JVP and many in the high-tech sector and other industries — have been instrumental in fostering cooperation and partnerships with other tech and business ecosystems, not just in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, but also in the Middle East. Countries like the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan have become allies in the pursuit of technological progress and economic growth.
We cannot let everything we built be destroyed by a government intent on harming Israel’s independent judiciary, a cornerstone of every democracy. The high-tech sector, along with various other industries, stands united in its commitment to safeguard the democratic values that have propelled Israel's success on the global stage.
Just as they have been warriors on the front lines of technological advancement, they are now warriors in the fight to protect their nation's democratic soul. The determination to overcome this existential crisis and uphold the core values that define Israel's identity and strength is a testament to the resilience and unity of the Israeli people. This pivotal moment calls for a resolute stance on the values that have shaped the country's history, and it is one that will shape its future.
We are going to overcome this, and the people who are trying to derail democracy today will be gone tomorrow. Often, in the history of countries, there are key moments of real, existential crisis that demand answers on values.
For Israel, this is one of those moments.

If it's anywhere as popular as the iPhone version, expect to see some big numbers over the next few weeks.
Of course any mobile user can access ChatGPT or other OpenAI tools via the web interface, but the superior experience of a dedicated app has proven extremely compelling, to put it lightly. iPhone users downloaded it half a million times in the first week, impressing everyone until Threads came along and blew it out of the water.
The ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version's features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too — so if you're iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.
Of course it won't be completely identical, since the two mobile operating systems differ in many ways. For instance, the June additions of Siri and Shortcuts to the app on iOS clearly won't be making the transition, but it's likely Android users will get something similar.
On Twitter, OpenAI said that the Android app would be “rolling out to users next week,” presumably in the U.S. first. No plans were mentioned for other countries, but it's likely that they'll follow after a few weeks or months. It was in a dozen more countries one week after its original release.
You can sign up to be notified when the app goes live by hitting “pre-register” on the Play Store.

36,"Bolt, ex-CEO Ryan Breslow subject of SEC probe",https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/21/bolt-ex-ceo-ryan-breslow-subject-of-sec-probe/,"Fri, 21 Jul 2023 21:11:23 +0000",The SEC is reportedly investigating whether federal securities laws were violated in connection with statements made when Bolt was raising money in 2021.,"Ryan Breslow, co-founder of the e-commerce software outfit Bolt, was subpoenaed along with the company last year by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission. The Information reported the news first on Friday.
A letter authored in April by a lawyer representing Bolt investors said the SEC was investigating whether federal securities laws were violated in connection with statements made when Bolt was raising money in 2021. The letter was sent to Bolt’s general counsel as part of a demand to inspect the company's records on behalf of two Bolt investors, Brian Reinken of WestCap Management and Arjun Sethi of Tribe Capital Management, who were Series C and B investors, respectively.
Per the letter referenced by The Information, it was alleged that Breslow “misled” investors while fundraising for the company’s $355 million Series E round, valuing the company at $11 billion. The attorney representing WestCap and Tribe Capital wrote that Breslow “made material misrepresentations about the Company’s financial condition and product pipeline that resulted in the Series E investors buying into the Company at a grossly inflated valuation.”

Fresh round of $355M lifts online checkout company Bolt into decacorn territory

Shortly after that Series E financing was announced in January 2022, Breslow made headlines in both positive and negative ways related to comments he made about competitors and investors, and ended up stepping down as Bolt’s CEO. Soon after, he launched a wellness marketplace called Love that, according to his LinkedIn profile, he founded in January 2022.
Asked about the subpoena and lawsuit, an SEC spokesperson tells TechCrunch that the agency “does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.”
In a separate matter, a lawsuit filed this week against Breslow by former board member Activant Ventures’ Steve Sarracino alleges that Breslow removed him and two other board members when they declined to help Breslow repay a $30 million loan. Sarracino’s suit also alleges that CEO Maju Kuruvilla and three board members appointed afterward did not force Breslow to make loan repayments.
When reached for comment, Breslow did not respond personally, but brought in a Bolt spokesperson who acknowledged the lawsuit regarding the loan, writing via email that, “Bolt is not the direct target of this litigation, and we continue to seek resolution of the outstanding amount. We remain well-capitalized and the existence of this outstanding obligation to the company does not and will not affect our day-to-day operations or prospects.”
At the time that Bolt announced its Series E funding, the company was a hot commodity.

Fintech Bolt just laid off over 100 employees across engineering, sales and marketing

Speaking about taking in $355 million, Breslow told TechCrunch at the time, “It may seem like a lot of money raised, but actually no, this is capital for us to be competitive. We don’t just want to be on par with competitors, but be better. The capital will enable us to bring in the best talent, make strategic acquisitions and expand into Europe, which is important to us.”
Though Bolt was having no trouble at that moment bringing in large amounts of capital, Breslow has been public about his struggles to attract Silicon Valley investors early-on. It was right after the Series E that he began publishing those thoughts on Twitter.
It wasn’t long after that he stepped down as CEO, insisting that his resignation was not tied to the attention his tweets attracted.
Soon after, it seemed like things continued to be like riding a rollercoaster for Bolt. The company was sued by one of its biggest customers in May 2022 (the case was settled months later). The next day, TechCrunch reported about a blog post CEO Maju Kuruvilla wrote that revealed a 131% year-over-year increase in shopper accounts, and a 192% YoY increase in total active merchant accounts.
Then just a few weeks later, Bolt laid off over 100 people in a restructuring move that Kuruvilla, again via blog post, attributed to shifting market conditions, writing, “It’s no secret that the market conditions across our industry and the tech sector are changing, and against the macro challenges, we’ve been taking measures to adapt our business. In an effort to ensure Bolt owns its own destiny, the leadership team and I have made the decision to secure our financial position, extend our runway, and reach profitability with the money we have already raised.”
Following the Series E, The New York Times reported that Bolt’s leadership began another round of talks with investors to go after additional capital at a higher valuation of $14 billion; however, that has not yet materialized.

You can finally enjoy the seamless, cashless payment experience that you may have heard about for years and avoid the awkward interaction of asking your local friends to pay and giving them paper money that they can't spend anywhere.
This week, China's two dominant mobile payment solutions, WeChat Pay and Alipay, announced that foreign users can now pay at Chinese retailers by linking their foreign credit cards, including Visa, Mastercard and Discover.
Previously, using WeChat Pay and Alipay in China required a local bank account, making it challenging for short-term visitors to use these payment methods. While paying has become breezier for those living in China, finding places that accept cash is now a headache for foreign visitors, as the two payments giants have largely replaced cash from metropoles to villages despite the government's efforts to warn merchants against rejecting cash.
The development is thus a huge improvement in foreign visitors' experience in China. Given Alipay and WeChat Pay are literally ubiquitous in both China's online and offline retail spheres, foreign visitors may now be able to hail a Didi car, ride the subway, rent a shared bike, buy fruit from a grocer, order food delivery and even shop online for myriad Chinese e-commerce goods.
WeChat's announcement provides useful details on what the setup looks like. To activate their WeChat wallets, foreign users will need to authenticate their identity by uploading their passports. Foreign phone numbers can be used for receiving verification codes.
Unfortunately, visitors won't be able to try out the digitized Chinese hongbao custom, which involves sending or receiving digital versions of auspicious red envelopes filled with money. This feature was originally what drove WeChat's early wave of mass adoption. Visitors also can't conduct money transfers, which is unsurprising given China's stringent control of capital flows across borders.
On WeChat, spending limits per transaction, month and year for foreign visitors are 6,000 yuan (around $835), 50,000 yuan and 60,000 yuan, respectively. Transaction fees are waived for payments under 200 yuan (around $28), and any amount above that charges a 3% fee. Exchange rates are based on the rates of the card organization and the issuing bank. 
The payments giants previously had plans to integrate with international bank cards, but those didn't materialize. Hopefully, the regulatory approvals and infrastructure are ready this time. We will report back once we've tried it out on the ground.

38,Threads in decline? Don’t count out Instagram’s new Twitter rival yet,https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/21/threads-in-decline-dont-count-out-instagrams-new-twitter-rival-yet/,"Fri, 21 Jul 2023 20:30:30 +0000","A Wall Street Journal article on Friday warns that Instagram's new Twitter competitor Threads is already losing steam.

By comparison, [&#8230;]","A Wall Street Journal article on Friday warns that Instagram's new Twitter competitor Threads is already losing steam. Citing third-party data from Sensor Tower, the paper reports the number of daily active users on Threads dropped for the second week down to 13 million, a 70% decline from a July 7 high point. By comparison, Twitter's daily active users are around 200 million. Despite this seemingly worrying trend, it's far too soon to count Threads out yet. By other metrics, the app is continuing to grow its user base and traction in global markets, which, in time, could also boost its usage — especially as the app's feature set improves.
It's expected that a highly anticipated new app would have stellar usage numbers in its early days as users set up their accounts, find and follow friends, and test out the app's capabilities. As the newness wears off, it's also typical to see usage numbers drop as users return to their old habits while determining if and how they'll continue to fit the new app into their daily routines. Plus, The WSJ points out, Meta executives said they planned for an eventual decline and don't see this usage drop as worrisome.
We don't either. Threads is still too new and too incomplete to make any sort of determination yet on its eventual fate. Could it be an early record-breaker that eventually flops? Sure. But it could also be a legitimate Twitter killer or mid-level success. It's just too early to tell.
Launched on July 5 to global markets, excluding the EU, Threads topped 100 million users within days of its arrival — becoming the fastest app to achieve that milestone, ahead of Pokémon GO, according to app intelligence firm data.ai. During its first three days, it had 18.3% of the daily active users of Twitter, or 54.4 million to Twitter's 298 million. By last week, data.ai estimated the app still had roughly one-fifth of the weekly active user base of Twitter.

App installs for Threads peaked on July 9, a few days after its launch, when 24.5 million people downloaded the app globally across iOS and Android, data.ai says. But though the initial buzz may be wearing off, the app has continued to clock in north of 1 million new downloads daily over the past several days, ranging from 1.76 million on July 16 to 1.06 million on July 20, for example. Any new app on the market would be thrilled to see numbers like these, though perhaps Threads should be judged more harshly because it has the advantage of the network effects delivered by the nature of its parent app Instagram and the broader resources of Meta.
Data.ai estimates the app has now seen 185.32 million cumulative global downloads.

Another key point to note is that Threads is catching on in emerging mobile markets where downloads are still growing. The U.S. is only its third-largest market, data.ai's analysis shows. As of July 17, India and Brazil accounted for a larger number of installs, at 60.1 million (32.6%) and 40.2 million (21.8%), respectively. The U.S. delivered 27.8 million downloads or 15.1%. That's why analytics firm Similarweb's analysis of U.S. Android usage declines — 21 minutes on July 7 to 6 minutes on July 14 — aren't able to tell the whole story.
Though Threads usage may have declined for now, as Sensor Tower data shows, its early usage numbers demonstrated its potential as a Twitter rival. In its first few days on the market, Threads users were spending 15 minutes on average per day on the app, across 9.4 app sessions. That's more than the “microblogging” category averages, which data.ai says includes Twitter, Truth Social, Mastodon and Bluesky. Microblogging users then spent 12.5 minutes per day, on average, across 7.8 app sessions.
What's stopping people from using Threads more as of late may not be disappointment with the concept of the app itself but rather its current feature set, as compared with Twitter. Threads, though now publicly available, is effectively still a beta — an unfinished app — without a number of the features users want in a microblogging tool, like a chronological timeline, following feed, the ability to view your likes, a fully functional web version, an edit button, support for multiple accounts and more. These features are still in the works, along with Threads' planned integration with ActivityPub, the protocol powering open source Twitter alternative Mastodon.
In one thread on Threads (ha), in fact, users rushed to defend the app against the narrative that the app was dead, remarking that people should be more patient and wait for the needed features, and reminding others that even Instagram wasn't an overnight success.
Another post, led by social media consultant Matt Navarra, asked “threads is…” To this, Instagram head Adam Mosseri replied “a work in progress.” Across hundreds of other replies, many posted positive messages, calling the app an “opportunity,” better than Twitter, an “inspiration,” “exciting” and more — an indication that Threads is already building a community of fans.
Another indication is the app's U.S. App Store rating, a 3.8-star rating across 20,000 reviews. Diving into where it's losing points, it seems many of those downrating the app are doing so due to its incomplete nature, calling it a “promising start” but removing stars for its lack of certain features. By comparison, Instagram has a 4.7-star rating and Facebook has a 2.3. Another thing Threads has in its favor, based on these reviews and other online conversations, is that the app, for now, feels “less toxic” than Twitter, several users have remarked.
While Twitter users are already dancing on Threads' grave, thanks to The WSJ report, the reality is that it's too early to report on Threads' week two usage declines and come to the conclusion that Threads is dying. An app that breaks records out of the gate and continues to add users still has plenty of runway ahead and has time to deliver on the features people want, in order to regain traction.
Even seven-year-old Mastodon, the decentralized social networking Twitter rival, is continuing to grow in the wake of Elon Musk's missteps with Twitter. After Twitter's acquisition, Mastodon peaked at 2.5 million monthly active users. When Threads, launched, Mastodon had fallen to 1.7 million monthly users. It has since begun to grow again, now seeing 2.1 million monthly active users. These things ebb and flow.
There's also an online culture that's more willing to experiment with new apps — whether that's Twitter alternatives like Threads and Bluesky, Reddit alternatives like Lemmy and Kbin, or new ways to network like TikTok instead of old-fashioned Facebook.
Plus, for Threads to succeed, Twitter doesn't have to completely fail. Users can pick and choose between them or they can use both. It's not necessarily a zero-sum game.
That said, Meta doesn't have a great track record for launching successful new apps having shuttered nearly everything it built (instead of simply acquiring) over the years. Threads could one day become another app added to its graveyard.
But in the meantime, an app with now an estimated 116 million users and growing is far from being “dead.”

The probe centers on Ford's efforts to put CATL's battery cell technology to use at an upcoming, $3.5 billion battery cell plant in Michigan.
In their letter, the chairs of the House Ways and Means Committee and Select Committee on China call on Ford to hand over details on its agreement with CATL by August 10. 
The representatives have asked for communications between Ford and the Biden administration relating to the CATL deal. They further called on Ford to explain how it will “ensure imports from CATL to produce LFP batteries in Michigan are free of forced labor or inputs from Xinjiang.”
Reached by TechCrunch, a Ford spokesperson declined to comment on the specifics of the letter. The spokesperson reiterated a statement that the automaker “alone is investing $3.5 billion and will own and run this plant in the United States, instead of building a battery plant elsewhere or exclusively importing LFP batteries from China like our competitors do.” 
Earlier this week, House Republicans announced a separate investigation into U.S. venture firms' investments in China.

In a reply, Pokimane also looks interested in making a debut, but we don't know what game they'll be playing this time around (if anything).
Ocasio-Cortez's famous Twitch moment back in 2020 instantly shot to the top of the record books, racking up 435,000 concurrent viewers — putting her in the top five most-watched Twitch streams at the time.
Twitch has grown a lot since 2020, and so have the records. In July of this year, Spanish streamer Ibai Llanos smashed existing records with 3.4 million simultaneous views for La Velada del Año III, a streamer celebrity boxing event. Llanos broke his own record, set in 2022, for the previous year's event.
AOC's previous stream wouldn't impress by today's Twitch standards, but the 2020 event was an iconic moment for the notoriously internet-inept realm of politics and for Twitch itself, which was well established but not yet the full cultural force it is today. During that stream, the lawmaker played Among Us — a whodunnit breakout multiplayer hit of that era — with star streamers Pokimane, Piker and DrLupo.
